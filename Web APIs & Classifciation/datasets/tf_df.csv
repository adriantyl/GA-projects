TIFU by accidentally hitting on a customer,t2_3q0ykzzz,"Not a long story but as a new years resolution I told myself I would make an effort to compliment people because it always makes me feel good when I receive one.
So this woman comes in and she's really nice and friendly and as I'm making her coffee we are having a chat and she has this huge belt that is absolutely covered in those sparkly jewel thingies. So I say. ""I really like your belt it's really shiny"" she smiles and says ""thanks"" so I go. ""I wish I could pull it off"" not thinking that it could mean something else other than I wish it looked good on me. she blushes and looks down and when I finish her coffee she looks at me and smiles and says ""thanks"" so my assistant manager comes over and she's like ""did you just tell her you wanted to take her belt off?"" My face goes red as I realise what I said. I explained it to my assistant manager who just laughed and told me to think about what i say before I say it 

Tl;dr complimented a customer on her belt and told her I wish I could pull it off.",4869
TIFU by making someone think I was going to murder and bury her,t2_azh6y,"This just happened and I can't believe I didn't think about the situation. For reference I am a pretty big guy, and don't exactly look like a teddy bear. I posted a folding wagon online and someone said she wanted it. To both of our surprise we work at the same hospital so drop-off / pickup would be easy. Our hospital is huge so she agreed to meet me at my car in a parking garage. The wagon was in my car and we greeted one another and I opened my trunk to get the wagon out. She immediately stepped back when I opened the trunk, then I saw it.

I will take a step back to mention that I spent last weekend at my parents house helping them tear down a shed and a bunch of trees. I had all the tools at my house so I brought them over to help. The tools include a shovel, pickaxe, sledgehammer, recirpocating saw, axe, hatchet, hacksaw, large blue tarp, work gloves and rope. They were all covered in mud. It was literally a murder and disposal kit, that all looked well used. I just put them in my trunk and forgot to take them out. I didn't notice them when I put the wagon in because it was morning and still very dark.

I explained the situation and took the wagon out for her. She ended up being coworkers with my mom, and remembered my mom mentioning the new shed at work a few weeks prior. So we had a laugh about it in the end, but I was certain I would be maced or tazed for sure.

TL;DR
I met a woman alone in a parking garage to sell her something from my trunk and left a DIY murder set in my car.

Edit: thank you all so much for the awards and assuring me in not completely stupid, just a little. This has been an awful few days for me for other reasons, so knowing I made some other people laugh or even smile is really helpful.",22880
TIFU by having my husband examine me,t2_8gfpn13y,"This happened last night.

I am seven months pregnant and girl, it has been a ridiculous ride thus far. Second pregnancy and the symptoms just keep a-comin’. Two of those are 1) varicose veins in places I didn’t know they could go— my whole vagina / vulva situation, and 2) prolapsed bladder (not a full prolapse but I can feel it happening and it is as unpleasant as it sounds). 

At this point in my pregnancy I cant see jack shit down there, and a mirror doesn’t work super well. So my dear husband has been doing periodic investigations to reassure me that my organs are still mostly inside my body and give an update to the whole sitch. He’s an incredibly funny man who has an expressive face, which is a big part of why It went off the rails.

He’s down there taking a look, and he is not holding back: he looks pained, like he’s viewing a corpse, telling me (lovingly, as a joke) that it looks like “a hamburger” down there, and generally giving an unfavorable report. This is all too much for me and my raging hormones, which either having me laughing, crying, or murdering kittens. I start laughing uncontrollably, he won’t stop with the jokes, and suddenly I let out a very long, sonorous fart, right in his face. He just says “OK,” gets up, and we both end up crying from laughing so hard from the ridiculousness of it all. 

End scene.

TLDR: my husband was sweetly examining my downstairs mix up for rogue pregnancy symptoms when I farted in his face.",9895
TIFU by taking a new dose of ADHD medication and trying to entertain my family,t2_9rkodgxe,"TIFU. Yes, today. Just now. I am still trying to manage the consequences of my actions.

I have been on ADHD medication for seven years now. I usually change back and forth between different meds yearly, or I'll stop taking them for months at a time.

For the past couple months, I've been taking Vyvanse daily in order to be productive during the COVID 19 lockdown. This has been going very well and has made me very productive and hardworking, which I love. My issue is, I'd gotten used to the dosage I WAS taking and went to the next higher dosage today.

My issue with ANY ADHD med is that when it wears off, it wears off HARD. I go from being composed, focused, and hardworking, to a hyper energetic, easily distracted, closest-you-can-get-to-being-a-crackhead-without-smoking-crack shithead.

I started crashing HARD by inspecting each of my family members for blackheads for 30 minutes. This SOMEHOW ended up in the kitchen, where I was staring at my mom's neck looking for blemishes.

We were all chatting, and I ended up next to my brother.

For years, he's been able to fart on command. He says ""do you hear that?..."" then rips ass sorta thing.

I have NEVER been able to do this, but I figured today was the day I would.

I rest my arms on the counter and look up at him.

""Hey do you hear that?""

Nothing. I try and try, I KNOW something is leaving the South Pole within the next 10 seconds.

Something did leave the South Pole.

It was NOT a gas like I'd intended. It was... a solid. A SQUISHY SOLID.

My eyes widened. My normal mind knew what I had just done was horrifically embarrassing. My crackhead mind (which was leading at the moment) decided to announce what had happened. It started with a light chuckle that turned into full blown laughter. The final thing I said to my family through laughter before waddling upstairs like a penguin incubating an egg was:

""Well.. I'm gonna take my leave now, seeing as I've gone and shit myself.""

TL;DR: I became VERY hyper after a new dosage of ADHD medication wore off, tried to make my brother laugh by farting on command, but instead just shit myself in the kitchen.

Edit: forgot a few words. Shitting yourself really brings you back to when you were 1.",387
Tifu by sitting too close to the fire to escape hell.,t2_5rfxegiq,"TL/DR down the bottom. 

Note: Maybe not suitable for arachnophobes. 

So this happened about 10 years ago in Australia, just outside of Jindabyne, NSW, we were all around 20 years old at the time and were looking forward to letting loose a little. 

A group of about ten of us went on a trip to a holiday house in New South Wales’ mountain region. It wasn’t cold enough to snow but the nights were pretty crisp, so we pulled up an old outdoor bbq and proceeded to build a fire. As it usually goes, the size of the fire continued to grow, and we were all nestling into our positions around it for optimal warmth. 

Then a couple of the boys came back from a wood hunt with a big branch that was pretty fresh (about 3-4 meters long and it requires 3 people to lift it) then they placed the heavy end on the fire, and we sat down to watch it catch. 

It was a fairly slow process because the fire wasn’t really big enough for the branch to catch quickly, and there was a bit of smoke due to the big chunk of bark wrapped around the end in the fire. 

Once it began to catch I scootched my seat a bit closer and bathed happily in the warmth. 

At this point someone said “what the fuck?!” And another shouted “ITS BREATHING!” As he pointed at the huge piece of bark which was now literally breathing in and out against the branch. We could hear sizzling and we all jumped up. Then it began. 

One Huntsman spider (big scary/hairy Mofo’s which are basically harmless in a giant Shaq-like way) crawled out of gap between the branch and bark and then just fell into the fire to die. Then another, and another and within 30 seconds it seemed like there were hundreds pouring out trying to escape the heat (imagine World War Z zombies but spiders). They quickly discovered they could avoid the fire by just running down the log and jumping onto the grass or going the whole way into darkness. 

I jumped up on my seat, as did a few others while the rest just ran onto the concrete into the safety of the light. Soon enough the whole ground was alive with spiders running through the grass and into the darkness. I was stuck on my seat just looking around at this waiting for it to end... but they just kept on pouring out of under the bark and either escaping or sizzling in the fire. The log was alive. Looking at the ground was like a horror acid trip, and the only thing protecting me was the old wirey camping chair I was perched on. 

Yet it kept on going. More spiders! The guys on the concrete were laughing because they didn’t want to go into the light and of course me and the other guys stuck in the spider sea like me were screaming and laughing hysterically. It was the end of the fucking world. 

After probably only 2 minutes (felt like much longer) the stream of spiders began to fade and the ones that made it were presumably making a break in the darkness for the trees while their comrades cooked. It died down surprisingly quickly because where their ‘nest’ was was now completely in flames and we all jumped up onto the concrete. 

After ten minutes the log was burning perfectly, we were getting chilly, and there literally wasn’t a spider in sight. We shook off our seats, checked every nook and cranny nearby, and after giving it enough thought, we all eased back into our positions and laughed traumatically until the adrenaline rush passed. It was so creepy that we literally couldn’t find a single one of them in the grass or around us but we figure we just had to do our best to stop thinking about it and continue drinking. 

TLDR: Sat to close to fire and I couldn’t escape an exodus of large spiders, so had to wait it out while standing on my seat.

Edit: whoa thanks for the awards but pease don’t use your money on this!!! And shoutout to the arachnophobes who dodged a bullet. 

P.S. As an Aussie, I understand the fear of the creepy crawlies... but I will take seeing a deadly spider or snake from a meter away any day, over seeing a bear or wolf from a mile!!!",15661
TIFU by assuming someone was a child...,t2_1uosb7aw,"So this was quite a few years ago now but I still think about it and feel awful.

I used to work in a pub where there were two sections. The lower section of the pub was for adults only, to drink and eat without the annoyance of children running around and making a ruckus. The upper section was for families with children.

One night it's quite busy and I'm doing my walk around the pub collecting empty glasses. I'm in the lower section of the pub and I spot a blonde woman sitting with what looked like a 5-6 year old blonde girl (her back was facing me so I couldn't see her face). Now normally I wouldn't have said anything but been as the general manager was on shift I didn't really have a choice. So I go over and speak to the blonde woman. ""Hello, I am so sorry but children are not permitted in this area of the pub, we have seating in the upper section...""

The little girl turned around to face me. My heart stopped. I started sweating profusely and I must have gone as red as a tomato. It turned out that the ""little girl"" was actually a little person. She must have been about 30 years old. I completely froze as she just started at me with a face of disgust, understandably. After what seemed like a year of my life, but was probably only about 3 seconds. I apologised and offered her a complimentary beverage. She declined. I apologised again and walked into the glass room. I sat down in the floor, put my face in my hands and prayed for the ground to swallow me up.

TL;DR: Tried to do my job properly for once and ended up offending a little person who I thought was a little girl.",19
TIFU by sending fake homework to school for 2 months,t2_45s3hug8,"So two months ago I had a problem. I wasn't doing any homework and I didn't really care that much until the day our teachers mentioned that our grades would be based on homework since they couldn't do exams(they didn't trust online exams and we couldn't go to school because of lockdown). So I was panicking thinking I was gonna get a very low score on all of my classes since I did at best 10 of the hundreds of homework's given this year. So I decided that I should just submit fake homework. Basically I made a program that would find blank spaces in the page and fill them with premade images of calculations and such. then I would just submit those. And it worked for like a couple months

&amp;#x200B;

But Today my teacher found something wrong with my uploads and decided to take a look he found out that none of the calculations I had on the math paper made any sense. Then he took a look at the other stuff I sent and found out that I'd been submitting fake homework for the past 2 months. Needless to say he told the other teachers about it and now I have to do 2 months of homework in the span of 3 days or I'm gonna be getting a 0 on my homework points

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I was sending fake homework and they found out and now I have to do 2 months of homework in 3 days",47
TIFU by scratching jalapeño pepper oil all over my naughty bits.,t2_bggkqb9,"Today my wife decided to make stuffed jalapeños. We’ve never made them ourselves so it was an exciting family experience. She cut them up, I scooped out all the extra stuff inside, and my youngest daughter made sure they were all clean and free of seeds.

All went well. They were a hit at the dinner table and perfectly complemented our gourmet meal of frozen taquitos, chips and melted Kraft cheddar cheese, and store-bought salsa. I know, nothing spectacular but it got the job done.

I rubbed my lips with my hands at one point and noticed that they got VERY tingly. “That’s funny”, I mused to no one in particular. So I proceeded to wash my hands quickly with a bit of soap and water. That should do it, right? 

Later in the evening, the kids were quietly and happily playing together for once, my wife was baking a wonderfully smelling concoction, and life was just pretty swell. 

And then I got an itch.

No special itch in particular. Just one of those usual itches that a guy can get on the shaft of his penis. I’ve had many in my 39 years of life. Just scratch it and carry on with life. 

Not today. No no, my friends. Today was not to be a usual day for me.

I scratched. It felt good so I gave it a few more scratches. Not to arouse myself, but just because it felt good like a back scratch can feel good. Unbeknownst to me, I was spreading microscopic droplets of satan’s own saliva-borne pepper oil all over my little friend. I washed my hands as a proper gentleman does and then went about my business.

Time passed (actually it was only about 45 seconds)

It began as a small tingling. The following was my next mistake in a long string of them. Before I knew what was going on, I decided to give Mr. Happy a few extra scratches. He had been a good boi so he needed that extra bit of love. More of Cthulhu’s cream was scratched in.

Now it REALLY started to hurt. This is when I finally came to the grave realization that my otherwise pleasant day was about to get nightmarishly awful. I yelped something to my wife. In my mind I said “Honey, I’m heading to the bathroom” in a manly voice. In actuality, I whimpered some kind of unintelligible gibberish to her before waddling as quickly as possible to the bathroom, pulling my pants down in the process.

Now, I had options. I could take a shower, I could use my newly-installed Christmas present, the bidet. Or I could squat in the bathtub and use the faucet as a life-giving waterfall. I chose the bidet firstly. Since it’s really only made to squirt the backside and the front for women, I had to turn it on and maneuver my chubby body all around. Water shirted everywhere. It was a mess. A terrible, ineffective mess. Next up was the bathtub. I squatted down in all my nakedness and let the cold water run all over my frank and beans. It felt temporarily better but not great.

Next, I chose the shower. I can tell you with no amount of uncertainty that even lukewarm water on the site of a pepper oil burn on the shaft of a penis feels like the devil has come to take you away, penis first. I screamed. 

I was out of options. No amount of water helped. I was in so much pain but had to find options. The first thing I saw was to use milk or yogurt. We don’t have yogurt. We do have milk. 

Fine.

I put a towel on. The fibers of the towel felt like they were puncturing my skin. But I had to make it to the fridge. I got a nice big glass of milk. My wife had a wooden spoon halfway into a mixing bowl but she was frozen in place, staring at her husband and wondering if he had finally fallen off the deep end. I waddled back toward the bathroom to the sound of one of my kids asking innocently why I was going to drink milk in the bathroom. 

After I made it back in, I closed the door and dipped my now bright red member fully into the milk. I heard a noise. I looked up. The doorknob was turning. I hadn’t locked the door. The last thing I wanted was one of my girls walking in and having her first glimpse of a male penis to be from her father dipping it into a glass of milk. 

No. NO!!!!

The doorknob stopped turning. I waddled over, spilling milk everywhere in the process. I would not let this day get any worse.

The next solution was alcohol. It seems counterintuitive, but I was out of options. I rubbed some isopropyl alcohol all over. Then I rubbed some milk. Then water. Rinse and repeat for 30 minutes. Finally things were starting to look up. The burn was subsiding slightly. I didn’t feel like I needed to cut it off to alleviate the pain. The satanic glory hole that I had found myself in was at an end. 

Afterwards, I took the coldest shower I have ever taken. I stepped out. Naked, shivering, penis looking like it lost a fight with a meat grinder, I was free. I was still in pain but I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I found my loosest pair of boxers, gingerly put them on, and waddled out to the living room. My whole little family was watching me, half-afraid and half-curious at what misadventure I had gotten myself into this time.

I had to explain to my girls that I scratched my bottom with pepper oil. Close enough. My wife wanted to see the damage. She stifled a giggle and told me she was sorry. She later told me we would laugh about this sometime. In the meantime, no peppers for me.

TL;DR - I had pepper oil in my fingernails and accidentally scratched it into the shaft of my penis. I experienced the Wrath of Satan himself.",102
"TIFU by swimming, causing 9 month marital separation &amp; brain damage (possibly)",t2_4ns8s6a9,"Obligatory this happened exactly one year ago.

My in-laws invited us on vacation to Hawaii. They paid for almost everything. They were very generous and I’m very grateful.

However, I’d been back for a few days and my ear was hurting. By the next day the soreness had greatly increased. It was at this point i knew i had an ear infection. But i also did not have health insurance. I was barely making more than minimum wage and really couldn’t afford insurance. However, that night i couldn’t sleep. It hurt far too bad. I googled every ear infection remedy i could and tried everything: hydrogen peroxide, qtips, warm compress, even candling on the off chance the heat would kill the infection. Nothing. I read on the internet that ear infections usually go away after a few days so i decided to tough it out. Even an obscene amount of sleeping pills failed to knock me out in the face of the pain. Finally, after the third straight day of no sleep i go to CVS and pay the steep price of $100 to get a doctor to look at my ear. It’s an ear infection alright. He gives me some antibiotic ear drops and sends me on my way.

The drops didn’t work. But i figured for an infection this bad they might take a while to have an effect. My USMC recruiter called and offered me an early ship date. Someone had chickened out and quit. It was Friday and he said he could get me on my way on Monday. My wife said i shouldn’t take it so we could spend more time together. Ultimately though, i took the early ship date. 

When I got to MEPS, I hadn’t slept for a week straight, i couldn’t hear out of the ear, and pus was oozing out. It’s possible i fell into microsleeps here and there but for the majority of the night i was awake and watching tv on my phone. I learn on arrival to the recruit depot that for the first two days of boot camp they don’t let you sleep. It was miserable and i was barely functioning.

On the ninth day i failed the heating test. This got me sent to a doctor to examine my ear. He said that my ear was detaching from my head. So he sent me to the naval hospital. They did a variety of tests, including an MRI. I was diagnosed with a severe case of mastoiditis.

Mastoiditis is an infection that starts in the ears, but then makes its way to the base of the head, about where the spine meets the skull. The infection then travels to the skull. When it gets into the skull it’s almost impossible to root out bc of the skull’s honeycomb structure. From there it attacks the brain and at this stage is usually fatal since even when treated bits of it would resurface in the skull and attack the brain again. According to the doctor who was explaining all this to me, i was at most days away from the point where death was almost certain.

The hospital prescribed me some pills. However, i was sent to the medical platoon to recover. This set me behind by three weeks. Then COVID struck. If I’d been with my original platoon i would’ve been able to have a normal USMC boot camp graduation. But because of this delay, i was in one of the first platoon’s whose graduation was cancelled. They also took away my boot leave. As a result, the anticipated 3 month separation from my wife turned into a 9 month separation as i finished up post boot camp schooling. 

On top of all that, i essentially went 9 days straight without sleep. I’ve since been reading on how severe sleep deprivation might cause permanent brain damage. While the effects aren’t really known well by science, or if it really causes permanent brain damage, i believe it. While other factors may be at play, since then I’ve developed a stutter, become confused more easily than before, have slower reaction times, much worse short term memory, and have greater trouble focusing on things. Course, that could just be in a stressful job in a new environment not having the time to read like i used to and I’ll catch back up to where i was. I’m really hoping it’s the latter

TLDR: swam in the ocean, causing me to be separated from my wife for 9 months and possibly causing permanent brain damage

I’ve been thinking about this lately because i have a medical appointment tomorrow for severe tinnitus and trouble hearing from one ear

"TIFU by Drinking Way Too Much, Passing Out, and...",t2_gikt6,"This happened about 10 years ago and it’s taken every single day since to be able to talk about this. 

One night, an ex and I decided to drink together. I’m not the biggest drinker in the world and don’t have an amazing tolerance so what you’d expect to happen, did in fact happen.

One second we were laughing, the room was spinning, everything blurred, and then lights out. 

When I opened my eyes, I noticed we were in bed together. I didn’t remember going to bed, in fact, I didn’t remember much at that moment, but it was light out, the birds were chirping, and something felt wet down by my butt area.

“Oh no… Did I pee the bed?” I thought in a mild panic. 

I lifted the sheets and to my absolute horror, I saw that didn’t pee, but rather, I had explosive diarrhea all over myself and her.

I’ve been through a lot of shit in my life, pardon the pun. Car accidents, near death experiences, brawls, police chases, and many other adrenaline inducing events and nothing, I repeat, nothing I have ever gone through, put me in such a state of panic as that very moment. 

I still remember the needle sensation all over my body as I began to flash sweat. 

I look over and she’s still sound asleep. Good. I have some time to figure this out. 

When you’re panicked like that, you start to think of some pretty crazy ideas. One of which was to blame it on her. Since the indent of her body caused a mud slide in her direction, thereby saturating her panties, all I had to do was remove my boxers and throw them out the window. Then, I’d gently wake her up and say, “Babe, listen, don’t be alarmed but you pooped all over yourself and me. Don’t be embarrassed, this stuff happens, and I still love you.”

I’d just have to scoop some of my poop into her butt crack to really sell it but, what if she woke up in the process? I think that would be somehow harder to explain. 

My other plan was to pull the sheets out from under her like some sort of lounge magician. I didn’t think it would work but I’d be a fool if I didn’t consider everything. 

Time is ticking and every second that goes by makes me panic more. We’re breaking up. She will immediately break up with me. I mean, I pooped all over her. Can a relationship really withstand that? Can she ever respect me again? Look me in the eye without thinking of someone else’s poop all over her butt? Can I think of her sexy round butt cheeks without them being tainted by images of my diarrhea all over them? 

While these, and a thousand other thoughts, race through my head, she wakes up. Her eyes slowly open and she gives me a smile and kisses me good morning. Our last kiss, I assume.

She tells me she had a good night. I was so funny how I passed out and she put me in bed. She doesn’t notice the mess she’s laying in. I hold those sheets down with all my might. 

After a few minutes of talking, she decides to get up to go to the bathroom. I tell her to wait.

“I have to tell you something.”

She looks at me concerned like I’m going to break up with her or something. I guess she could read the seriousness of my face. 

“I need you to slide out of bed and go take a shower. Don’t look at the sheets. Don’t look at anything, just go in the shower right now.”

She was always the type of girl who would do the exact opposite of what you told her to do. She ripped the sheets off me, saw me laying in my shame, and started laughing hysterically. 

She laughed for what seemed to be 25 years. She’s probably still laughing now. 

She told me not to worry, she’s a nurse and she sees this every day. She smiled and shook her head. 

I balled all the sheets and told her I’d wash them. Her condo didn’t have machines so I told her I’d take them with me. I remember carrying a ball of poop sheets, naked, around her place because I didn’t know what to do with them. 

She took them from me and said she’d take care of it, she was used to cleaning poop at the hospital. She never brought it up again and she made me feel real comfortable about it. We didn’t break up. Then at least. The relationship lasted 4 more years after that but not before her dog licked my butt hole during sex once but that’s another story for another time. 

I wish that was the only time I got drunk and pooped. The other time, I was with a bunch of my cousins and they told me that I was so drunk that I pulled my pants down and pooped in the corner in front of everyone. Then I went to sleep. They left it there for me to clean up in the morning. 

The crazy thing is, I don’t know this person. I feel like some sort of werewolf who loses all recollection of a night of ravaging the town except, instead of terrorizing villagers, I’m shitting on people and things and losing all memory of it.

I’m terrified of drinking too much now. 

TL:DR: I'm like the Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of poop and shit all over my ex after a night of drinking.",59
TIFU by wearing a pad while on my period,t2_pm4x4,"I am on my period. TMI, but you need to know that for this story. 

Also, for anyone who doesn’t know ... a sanitary pad is sticky on the underside so it stays in place in your undergarments. It also has a small piece of wax-paper-like packaging on the inside that you have to remove so you can fold down these sticky little “wings” and stick them to the underside of your underpants.

Now to today’s FU. I am a proud mama to two toddlers who enjoy waking up WAY too early in the morning. I woke up and realized I needed a pad before starting my day. I just bought a new brand to try out, so I opened a new pack and put the pad in place so it could do its job while I do mine. 

This new brand of pads was SO UNCOMFORTABLE! I was having a hard enough time adjusting to these itchy new pads when I “sprung a leak” and needed a wardrobe change. I marched into the bathroom to rip this thing out and swear them off forever ... when I discovered that I had placed the pad correctly, but then failed to remove the inside wax paper liner thingy. Hence the discomfort and leakage. 

TL;DR - put in a pad this morning, forgot to take off the inside liner so it was uncomfortable and leaky all morning. Leaned the dangers of being on my period while tired.",313
TIFU by giving to my uncle's son a new Apple sticker,t2_4dyiujcp,"My uncle with his son (8 years, let's call him Peter) decided to visit us today. They live in a different city and wanted to meet us all for the first time this year.

So the tech addicted Peter came with his tablet and his smartphone. Sat near my grandma and started playing. Both the tablet and his smartphone have an iphone sticker on the back, for the fun I guess, because neither is Apple's product.

Later in the day some family members including my uncle &amp; son went for a short walk. My grandma and I stayed.

Grandma asks me : ""You saw? Small Peter has an iPhone right? Must be expensive""
Me: ""No no, those are just stickers""
Grandma : ""Oh haha, it looks pretty anyways""

Then I recall that I have 2 new stickers which came with a Macbook that I recently bought. So I decide to give 1 of them to Peter when he comes back.

He returns, I show him the gold colored sticker, he seems excited, we start the replacement process. Peter takes his smartphone, pulls off the old Apple sticker and handles the phone to me. I place the new sticker by making sure that it covers the ""SAMSUNG"" mark that was hidden by previous sticker.

I am proud of myself. The new sticker is way shinier and is perfectly centered. Peter thanks me but seems concerned. 5 mins later he approaches his father and I hear him say ""Daddy, daddy ... my phone is a Samsung ... did you know? ..."".

I shouldn't had given him the new sticker.



TL;DR : My uncle's 8 year old son had an Apple sticker on the back of his smartphone. I gave him a brand new sticker for replacement. During the process the kid discovers that his phone is indeed a Samsung. Starts complaining to his father.",928

TIFU by falling down a Reddit rabbit hole

On a mobile blah blah format, and dyslexic just to really spice up your reading pleasure. 

Dear reader may this serve as a lesson to us all. 

This happened last month. I have been using this  internet sensation much more of late and often can get sucked right in as I’m sure all of you are more than aware of doing as well. What can I say? I’m just trying to get down with the kids. Anyway I was on this subreddit reading an xxl TIFU and my daughter called me, I walked down two stairs completely invested and absorbed in the story, missed my footing and fell all the way to the bottom, fracturing 3 fingers and a foot. So for all you brilliant story tellers thank you for making me not be able to do housework for quite some time!

Me not knowing wtf just happened could not answer her questions which made her even more suspicious. After 1-2 hours of explaining and reassuring her I didnt mean it and I was talking in my sleep we were fine again, but she thinks what I say in my sleep 'has to come from somewhere'. 
Today we looked it up and I showed her the sites that said that people who talk in their sleep often say offensive things, similar to tourettes. This made her more accepting of the incident. So I lost a part of my gf confidence in me and my night sleep because of talking in my sleep.

750 characters minimum is a lot so ill just write a TLDR:

I talk during my sleep, new gf heard me say I wanted to breakup, she cried which woke me up all confused, had to explain her I didn’t mean it, lost a part of her confidence in me (and my night sleep)",294
TIFU by falling face first in fresh cow dung,t2_8u67l9et,"I went for a walk today in a rural areaI close to where I live. I was walking along a rugged path that happens to pass through a field with cows. I noticed a lady and her two daughters walking in my direction. I found myself looking ahead at them rather than what was directly in front of me. I immediately regretted not looking at the path when I tripped on a large rock lay on the ground. I completely lost my balance, causing me to fall face first towards the ground, when falling time seemed to slow down as I realised my face was about to be cushioned by a mound of fresh cow dung. It was so fresh that my face sunk in and became fully submerged. I can hear laughter from the lady and her two daughters. This laughter turned into hysterics when I got myself up and they could see my faeces covered face.

TL;DR
Fell face first in cow poop",8
TIFU by not listening to online tips and naming my cat after food.,t2_3u4l801a,"Good  8 months ago I decided to adopt a cat. And because he was all white I named him Sugar. First few days he was having diarrhea. At first it was whatever but later his diarrhea would stuck around his anus hair. There's nothing that few wipes can fix right? After cleaning him I went online to read some tips for cat lovers. There was one tip for long fur cats about cutting  fur around cats anus. At that time I didn't think that my cat had long fur so I ended up not using that tip. And later I  forgot about it

So this happend 2 hour ago.  Around 8 in the morning I woke up to my cat digging a hole in his litter box. 10 minutes later he was still in his litter box trying to do something. As I was about to turn on the lights he started pooping. Great finally I can sleep again. No... After finishing he started to cover up his mess with litter so he made even more noise. Then it got quite for a second and I heard him scratching floor.  I thought it was weird because he never does that. While I was thinking my sis came into my room and asked if I want rice porridge. I said yes and  then she asked if I want it with sugar or salt. See where this is going? 

I said that I want it with sugar but she didn't heard me. And because I was angry  and sleepy I rised my voice so she could hear me and said SUGAR! My cat who was still scratching floor looked at me and thought he did something bad  got scared and run under my bed. And with him running the smell came. I turn on the lights and I see trail of poop from his litter box going to my bed and around it. At first I thought he was having diarrhea while he was running which I thought was kindda funny. But then I see massive amount of turd around his legs and his anus and then it strucked me that my cat has long fur and I remembered that tip from months ago. I thought I can still use baby wipes to clean him but turns out I didn't have any left

In the end I had to torture my cat with water so I can clean his fur, cut his fur around his anus. Got 100 more scratches on arms. I cleaned my room but it still smells like a$$

TL;dr: Didn't listen to important tip for cats online ended up with  trail of poop around my room",21
TIFU by becoming violently ill while in the middle of doing a tattoo,t2_2ua7l11d,"Trigger warning for those squeamish about puke , suffer from emetophobia, or are unlucky enough to be eating breakfast when reading this post. 

TL;DR at bottom 

Now, let me put this out there: I am 42 now and have suffered from severe emetophobia for most of my life(for those that don’t know what it is, it is a severe phobia of vomit, or feeling like you have to, or are consumed with anxiety that someone else will.) Like all phobias, of course, they make no sense, but the absolute terror and panic they can cause can be *terrifying*. 

For many emetophobes, through sheer force of will, we can usually suppress the urge to vomit and I am usually a champion at this. Up until yesterday, it had been over ten years since the last time I vomited and though I am currently dealing with an illness that often makes my stomach flaky as hell, I have medication I can take but, I can usually power through it.

I am also a tattoo artist and I was tattooing one of my regulars when my stomach started to do that thing it does when it’s like “Bitch, you better get to the bathroom *now*!!!”

So I went into the bathroom, took my mask off, tried to take slow, deep breathes, put cold water on my face. Nope, I couldn’t even control it and it felt like it would never end. I had to call my coworker into the bathroom because I couldn’t do anything more than slump again the floor by the toilet.

I explained to my coworker what was going on, that I was going to have to finish this tattoo another time and I was going to have to tell my client what was going on and I wasn’t going to charge him what I already did cuz I already felt like a huge douchebag because he waited for a few a weeks for this appointment. 

My coworker went into my office and explained and I just about got to the part where I asked my coworker to wrap him up when I had to run back to bathroom and round two began. 

So, I just want to make it known that I’ve been tattooing for 25 years, and I’m not one of those assholes who runs home at the slightest sniffle. I’ve tattooed while going through cancer, I’ve tattooed with broken bones, I’ve tattooed with stitches holding my hand together, I say all this so it’s known that I’m not some light-weight whining about a little tummy ache. 

This was awful and humiliating and then to make it worse, I had to explain to my manager why my client filled out his consent forms but there was no money from it. Today, I’m going to rest and attempt to eat something. Wish me luck on having a cooperating stomach. 

TL;DR-I was a good hour into doing a tattoo when the wrath of god himself descended on my stomach. Couldn’t stop puking and was unable to finish my clients tattoo .

TIFU: The Peanut Butter Incident,t2_87n0y,"Obligatory this happened around 11 years ago, around the time my wife (lets call her Wifey) and I had been dating for 1 month.  We are a blended family, which amounts to myself have 3 from previous, she has 3 from previous that I adopted, and we now have twins together.  At this time of the story though, there were no twins.  

Wifey's sister and said sister's kids were visiting, and I was visiting with my 3 kids. We planned to have a nice kid get together to hang out, have fun, eat some food, and have a sleep over.  This amounted to 14 people (3 adults and 11 kids, aged 2 to 12) hanging out in a small single-wide trailer.  The night started out normal. All the kids were playing while us adults hung out and talked.  Kids running back and forth across the house was nothing new to any of us, and the kids were happy to have others to play with.  We decided to make a nice quick ""kid"" dinner, and cooked a proverbial shit ton of Totino's Pizza Rolls.  The kids were excited for them and with that many small mouths to feed it was a nice quick meal.  We all chomped them down to where there wasn't a crumb to be seen, and everyone was full and content.  After Dinner, we all sat down and watched a movie, then sent the kids to bed.  Shortly thereafter, the adults went to get some shut-eye.

Screaming and Crying!  I woke up to the sound of what could only be described as people's souls being ripped out of their very bodies. As a parent, waking up to a kid crying is nothing new, but this was on a whole different level.  It almost sounded like the house itself was in painful agony. I shot out of bed and tried to locate the origins of the sound, but i was coming from all around me.  I honed in on one of them, and ran into the room they were in.  All the kids in that room were crying and moaning.  I could quickly tell that all the other kids and adults were doing the same thing.  I asked what was wrong, and before any of them could complete the sentence telling me their stomach hurt, they all started projectile vomiting en mass.  The sound of the hurling was also in stereo, because the other kids and adults in the other rooms were also doing it at the exact same time.

Now I want you to think about the most graphic war movie you have seen, but replace blood with vomit, then multiply it by 5.  Kids were laying on the bottom bunk, their vomit hitting the underside of the top bunk. Kids were spraying vomit across the walls.  Rivers of it was flowing from the bed onto the floor. A few kids in other rooms thought they could make it to the bathroom, only to spew themselves empty all along the hallway floor and walls. The other adults were vomiting with a mindful approach, but it was still uncontrollable.  The whole house reverberated the sounds of retching, pain, and horror of what they were doing.  This felt to go on for hours, but in all honesty, it probably lasted around 25 minutes before everyone's tank was on E.

I had not vomited at all (i have had bad GERD my whole life that leads to vomiting, so I'm pretty good at keeping it down), and Wifey was the second most cognitive, but she cannot handle puke at all, so I spent the next few hours cleaning up as much as I could, scrubbing walls, removing bed linen, scrubbing mattresses, and soaking/cleaning up the literal rivers of puke going throughout the house.  The worst part about it though, is for some awful reason, it all smelled like peanut butter!

TL;DR - Some bad pizza rolls caused the worst mass case of food poisoning I have ever seen, amounting to a trailer filled with 14 people all puking their guts out at once.",7
TIFU by getting caught with a buttplug,t2_hia00ni,"Due to the pandemic I (22F) have been living with my family. On top of that my cousin (16F) has been living with us since she has some issues living with her own parents.

Essentially after I was done using my toy I went to go clean it in the bathroom. My cousin is really quiet so she snuck up on me in the bathroom while I was cleaning it to call me for dinner. She freaked out when she saw it and this is the first time a family member caught me with it lol. Honestly I was mortified.

This might not seem like a big deal (this subreddits filled with stories like this) but this is the first time someone caught me with it and knowing my cousin she might (unintentionally) spill it to my family or her siblings and I reeeeeally don't want that to happen pls help me

I thought of different lies for an explanation but like I'm pretty sure she saw it. I thought maybe I could play it off as ab object that kinda looks like a buttplug?? But I cant think of any ahhhhhh

TLDR I got caught cleaning my buttplug by my nosey cousin who might spill it to other family members and I need a cover up story lol",69
TIFU by offering my partner a spoonful of chocolate ice cream,t2_964g9abu,"TIFU by offering my partner a spoonful of chocolate ice cream. He recoiled as far back as he could, eyed me suspiciously and said ""What's that?""

Why?

Well, Yesterday I fucked up because I was a touch preoccupied with a project I'm working on. The cats started hollering at me for food, as cats do, and in the interest of not being distracted by their pawing and meowing and climbing on me I went to the kitchen to feed them. I opened the can, spooned the food out onto the plate, rinsed the can and tossed it into the recycling bin. Then I picked up the plate of cat food, walked right past the confused and dismayed cats, out of the kitchen and into the living room. I walked to my partner's desk, and lovingly presented him the plate of cat food. His confused and slightly horrified look snapped me out of my reverie. I looked down at the plate of cat food and started laughing hysterically at myself and apologizing at the same time. Then I went back and gave the plate to the cats. We giggled about it for hours.

Anyway, apparently it's pretty hard to tell the difference between cat food and chocolate ice cream when somebody is shoving a spoonful containing a suspicious brown lump at you. Fair, you know?

tl;dr: Yesterday I fucked up by trying to feed my partner cat food. TIFU by offering him chocolate ice cream that looked like cat food. He was concerned.",25
TIFU by not checking my sound setup in a meeting,t2_108o36,"This happened about an hour ago

Some background information, our neighbors are currently getting a loft extension

I had to present a presentation with a group over Microsoft teams. I wasn't looking forward to it but it had to be done. In a pre meeting call with my group, I was testing different microphones to see which was the best quality. After finding the best microphone my neighbors decided to start drilling and sawing. because I didn't have the time to go round and ask them to stop, I just sighed. 

My team and I joined the call and started presenting. While we are presenting, when my slides are not up, I am muting my headset to avoid any background noise from the drilling. When my slides come up, I unmute myself and start talking. The drilling gets even louder and annoying. I grit my teeth and carry on. After my slides have finished, I mute my headset once more and say quite loudly ""for fuck sake, fucking hell"".

my friend then sends me a message on snapchat saying ""yo don't swear"". I was very confused as to how she knew I had said anything. I then looked at my laptop. At this point, the penny dropped like an atomic bomb. I had left a microphone plugged in. this meant that whenever I thought I had muted myself, I hadn't.

I nearly ripped the other microphone out of the usb port and quickly changed my settings on teams. the rest of the presentation didn't go too badly however and wasn't marred by my mistake. 

I was just thankful that I fucked up the most out of my group because I am able to laugh about it.

TLDR: didn't check the mic i was using in an online meeting, dropped two F bombs and covered a significant part of the meeting in drilling noises",9
"TIFU by explaining to a young Muslim girl, what porn is.",t2_kf2a8,"Obligatory this didn't actually happen today but 7-8 years ago, but it still makes me cringe and I still think about it a lot. So here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I used to teach English in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and I had students from all over the world and a significant number were from East Asia and the Middle East. This particular class, almost all of them were from Libya. IDK if you're familiar with the Arabic language but they lack certain sounds e.g. ""chuh"" and in ""Chair"" or ""Puh"" as in ""Person"". For instance instead of pronouncing it ""Pepsi"" they call it ""Bebsi"".

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm in class doing this exercise with them to help their pronunciation where you place a piece of paper in from of your mouth and say a work that starts with ""b"" like ""born"" and the paper has to stay still, and you say a word that starts with ""p"" like ""pen"" and you have to push a puff of air out with the ""p"" to make the paper move. It just sounds like a breathy, exaggerated ""p"" but it helps them differentiate between ""b"" and ""p"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway class is over and this young maybe 18-19 y.o, very sweet Muslim girl comes to my desk and she goes ""teacher what is porn?"" with a very exaggerated, breathy ""p"", and I kind of get flushed and mumbled a little and try to explain:

""Well... It's like a movie but for adults, not for kids... It's not very nice""

""Movie for old beoble?""

""Well not exactly old people, but it shows things that aren't suitable for younger people, It shows people begin very close to each other""

""Teacher, I don't understand. What mean when you say ""I was porn in Libya""

So apparently she was still stuck on the exercise and was pronouncing all Bs as hard Ps. At this point I'm turning purple for trying to teach her about porn and I'm struggling to explain birth without using my hands and mimicking a vagina. So I tell her in means it's your country and look it up in a dictionary.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Young mulling students asks me a question incorrectly, I end up explaining her to her what adult movies are. SMH",77
TIFU by talking smack about my date with my mom,t2_ctncv,"To give some context, I have been seeing this guy I met on a dating app for about 2-3 weeks. Our first few dates were pretty good, but a consistent problem is that this man is ALWAYS working. I'm talking 18-hour workdays, on call on weekends, etc. He's an investment banker in NYC at a relatively new job, so to some extent, I get it.

Our 4th date (where this royal fuckup occurred) almost never happened. He'd spent the previous 3 days committing to plans with me, pushing the time back repeatedly, before eventually canceling because of work. The third time this happened, I was fed up and broke things off. He was repentant and asked for another chance...to which I obliged, because I thought he was a sweet person with good intentions.

Saturday night rolls around and he manages to make it to my apartment. I pour us some wine, and start getting excited about finally spending some time with him. Within about 20 minutes, he suddenly asks if he could use MY computer to send some emails! I was FUMING. This guy breaks promises 3 days in a row, begs for me back, then can't even spend half an hour with me uninterrupted?! I brusquely hand him my computer, pour myself a big ass glass of red wine, and go into my room while he's out working in the living room.

I am very close to my mom, and she knew this boy was on thin ice. I start texting her about how furious and disrespected I feel. My mom is a very, umm... straightforward and blunt woman. She sends some scathing texts saying his boss is taking advantage of him, the job sounds shady, she hopes he's making a ton of money, etc.

At this point he comes in and asks if I have Excel on my computer. I tell him NO (lmao). He leaves, and this is where I realize how royally I have fucked up. My text messages are connected to my computer, and this guy is reading every single one that pops up on the top right of the screen. My heart nearly fell out of my butt and I called my mom, whisper-yelling, ""HE CAN SEE THE TEXTS. DON'T SEND ANY MORE."" I am panicking, but I can't stop laughing because frankly, screw this guy. My mom laughs too. I get a text from my roommate asking if I'm okay, and that makes me laugh even more.

For the rest of the night, I pretended I didn't know about the messages. I wish I could say the date was smooth-sailing after that. Dark secrets were revealed, there were tears from both parties, both of us stormed out on each other at different points, and he told me he thinks I am going to hell (he's religious and I am not).

Somehow, after all this, he ended up staying the night. The next morning I turned to him and said, ""Hey, just so you know, I know you saw all the messages when you were working on my computer. Sorry about that.""

His response: ""What messages?"" ... -\_-

HE HADN'T SEEN THEM. And then I had to explain myself hahahahaaaa kill me

TLDR: Don't share your devices with a date unless you are okay with airing your dirty laundry.",22
TIFU by drunkenly thinking a dog would adhere to a human rule,t2_1dn5uwh1,"So this happened a couple months  ago,  I had kind of forgotten abt it until my girlfriend was asking me questions abt the scar on my leg. 

So I started bjj training recently which involves grappling your opponent until you have an advantage to choke or contort their bodies, forcing them to give up and “tap out”. This is very standard procedure and take a little bit to get used to. But after a couple months you learn to tap out the second you feel any type of pain you shouldn’t.  

Fast forward a little bit and it’s Halloween. 
I get invited to a party by a friend (let’s call him Adam)and I show up around 9 pm. Everything is going great, I meet this nice girl and we’re chatting before she asks me for a smoke. I happily obliged and we headed to the backyard.

As I was closing the sliding door I saw a flash of movement in it’s reflection and wheeled around to find myself face to face with the biggest dog I’ve ever seen in my entire god damn life. Had to be part Rottweiler, Part Pit Pitbull, and part Sabertooth Tiger. It easily weighed 200 lbs and was wrapped in muscle like it ate bricks and steroids for breakfast. Naturally the girl I was with started petting him and calling that murder machine a “good boy”. I kept my distance while trying to inhale my cigarette in one breath so I could get away from that beast.

I feel like now is a good time to mention this was a COSTUME party. I was in a full kangaroo onesie with the tail and pouch and everything while my female companion went for more of a “death metal drummer x lifeguard” type deal going on. 

This is where my true fuck up began. About halfway through my dart our lovely canine companion discovers I have a tail and furiously begins to chomp on it like a chew toy. I pulled it away from her and held it in between my thighs, hoping it wouldn’t be able to see it and it’d fuck off after a second. No such luck I’m afraid. 

This locomotive of an animal shoved her head in between my legs with so much force my legs buckled. She immediately saw the tail as I dropped to one knee and chomped down on it, as well as clamping down on the inside of my left leg at the same time.  Now I’ve been around dogs my whole life so I know what a dog bite feels like. THIS. Was not ANYTHING like that. The pain was so immense and sudden I immediately tapped on the ground. Only to realize, she did not give a fuck about me tapping. By this point I could see some blood soaking through my onesie and was in full blown panic mode. But right as I started having visions of leg amputees I hear the sliding door slam open and what sounded like god himself coming to save me, my friend managed to get her off of me and drove to the ER for a handful of stitches. 


TL:DR: almost got part of my leg chewed off because I thought a dog would let me tap out",3
TIFU by mistaking dried bone broth for beef jerky and pouring it down my gullet.,t2_8aryl,"My wife and I have recently been trying to find different ways to lose weight. One of those ways involve changing some of our eating habits. About a month ago, she discovered a brand of protein bars that she started using as meal and snack replacements. She offered it to me a few times and I finally caved about two days ago. Instantly was amazed by the flavor and incorporated into my diet as well.

Fast forward to today, and for dinner, we had had a smaller than usual portion of food, and about 2 hours later, I was hit with a craving for more. She was in the wash, so I decided to creep into the pantry and see if we had anymore bars that I could snack on. Saw the bag of bars but then I noticed another pouch by the same company, that was next to the bars and unopened. This unopened pouch of secrets (not see through) caught my eye with a curious wonder. Without actually reading the bag, I glanced at a few images and saw a Cow on it. I knew I had hit the jackpot: This amazing brand who makes protein bars also makes its own beef jerky.

Instantly, I went and opened the pouch with scissors and inside were small, skinny individual packaging. No matter. Nowadays, many beef jerky brands have come out with sticks so I thought nothing of it. Since it was so small, I thought to myself: “Head back and bottoms up”. Whelp, as the pour began, a mound of powder hit the back of my throat. I had flashbacks to the Cinnamon challenge I did like 10 years ago 🤮. I began to cough and was bewildered by this inconsistency with my expectations. While navigating a could of dust and saliva, I grabbed the parent packaging and look underneath the cow to read: dried bone broth. It was like concentrated seasoning within my mouth. The overwhelming flavor was terrible at that volume and due to expectation management, ruined my snacking moment.

After cleaning the mess I had created (literally spitting up this stuff and it was everywhere), I went to shower. My confused wife noticed me as I walked into the bathroom after her and asked why I was covered in powder. I told her what happened and she was in tears. She always gets in me for skimming everything I read and not paying attention and this was a victory for her. For once, I had to just laugh at myself because she was 100% right. Apparently bone broth is becoming popular in the mainstream so a lot of brands are starting to branch out and sell it and the brand who makes the protein bars had it as a promotional sample offer, hence the unique packaging.

TLDR: In a momentary lapse of judgement and increased greed, I attempted to consume a package of concentrated bone broth and made a mess in my home. Not super crazy but definitely leaned to pay more attention.",10
TIFU by misplacing my fish oil capsules.,t2_14uik3,"This all started last weekend when I got up on Saturday and got out my supplements. A couple fish oil capsules and some vitamin d3. I swear I remember setting them down on my night stand, then I went to go get water, and promptly forgot to take them. I remembered not too long after and went to go take them, and they're gone ? Okay. I looked *everywhere*. I could not find them. After 10 mins I started doubting I even got them out in the first place?? Okay whatever. I got out some more. The other ones will turn up, right?

Boy, did they ever. This evening I started my laundry. My first load is done, I transfered it over to the dryer, and when it's finished? I opened my dryer and immediately knew my fuck up, the entire load absolutely reeked like warm fish oil. I just restarted that load in the washer for the 4th time. I added lots of vinegar and borax in addition to laundry soap. I hope it works this time. 

TL;DR I misplaced my fish oil capsules last weekend, they ended up being in my laundry, and I consequently made my laundry reek like fish.",22
"TIFU by taking ""You won't like this"" literally.",t2_u74d3,"Over the years when it comes to certain foods at family reunions, Sunday dinners, or at a BBQ hosted by friends, people tasting things will sometimes tell me that I will not like it, along with a funny smile or smirk of a sort.

Since these people are of course trusted family and friends, I took them at their word and simply did not taste or eat the food they pointed out. After all, they are just looking out for me and I have no reason to suspect or question their word on such a simple thing such as food. There was almost always plenty of other food to eat.

Today, I find out they have all freaking lied to me. Decided to eat something anyways and omg was it delicious.

Years of unknown regret rained on me when someone explained to me the phrase *you won't like this* means you will **love** it.

Well the video ""Terry a. Davis gets a phonecall"" comes up and she clicks it. About 30ish seconds in he says ""I'm not a ni----, I wrote my own compiler"" it took her 5 seconds to realise but it was too late, she closed the tab extremely quickly and called me out and said ""Did you know he was a racist?"" I had to make up some excuse of me just hearing from a friend about him, so yeah. Got off with making my teacher play a racist video. Nice.

TIFU by using StarSan in a Neti bottle for sinus rinse.,t2_7a25h,"About 4 months ago I embarked on my first attempt at homebrewing with a batch of mead. Per online sanitation recommendations, I purchased a bottle of StarSan and diluted it to the recommended concentration for a gallon of distilled water, which I left in the stock plastic Great Value container. I'm sure it is obvious where this is headed now, but StarSan is essentially odorless and tasteless. I proceeded to irrigate my sinus cavities. Panic ensues, but I proceeded to work and dealt with what amounted to the worst runny nose in history. Never any blood at least. I was unable to taste or smell anything for about two weeks, which just so happens to be a symptom of Covid 19 which I fretted over for 4 days until I could get tested. Negative, much to my surprise, because I clearly had no sense of smell or taste whatsoever. I didn't really appreciate what StarSan is exactly until tonight. I thought I had just sprayed some soap up my nose and it burned for a few hours. It is phosphoric acid. Glad it was diluted I guess. Mark your containers people.  FWIW, I'm much better now and may have even caught the faint whiff of one of my own farts earlier tonight.

TL;DR Sprayed StarSan up my nose, thought I had Covid because I couldn't smell or taste for weeks, just found out it is phosphoric acid.",8
TIFU by renting my car on Turo and was instantly transported into an episode of Shameless,t2_ni17c,"So we bought a new vehicle this summer and have not used the other car we had since I work from home and my wife stays home as well. I tried to sell it, but we're upside down. Whatever. 

Last week, I had this genius idea to put it up on Turo. If you don't know, Turo is an app where you can rent out your car. I figured that a few rentals a month would cover the car payment. 

I created a listing for the car in the app and got it registered, cleaned, and disinfected so it'd be ready in case I got a reservation. I made sure all of the paper work was in the car and our personal belongings were out. I filled up the gas tank. I thought I'd for sure get a great review if I had both phone type charger cables in the car. Damn I'm good, I thought of everything. 

Now, my wife was not on board for this. She didn't like the idea of strangers using our car. I figured since we don't use it or need it and that it's insured, the worst case scenario was manageable. 
We recently watched the Will Farrell/Mark Wahlberg movie The Other Guys and my wife seemed oddly fixated on the fact that someone would allow a homeless orgy in our car if we rented it out. 

On Thursday I got my first reservation and was stoked. 

Now, the red flags were numerous, but I ignored them unfortunately. 
The renter immediately contacted me and asked to move the reservation to an earlier time - from about 4 hours away to about 30 minutes away at 7:30pm. They also asked if I would deliver it. Being excited for the beginning of my new money making scheme, I agreed. 
I arranged for my son to follow me to deliver the car and we dropped it off with the lady who reserved it. She assured me that she would take care of the car and that she would just be driving around town. 
It wasn't in the nicest neighborhood, but this is Utah. The worst neighborhoods in Utah are still much nicer than where I grew up in NW Indiana. I don't judge. 

So, as my son and I began to drive home and joked about all the bad things that could happen, my wife calls and asks if I had seen the email from Turo. Obviously I had not checked my email while I was driving. She went on to tell me that Turo's verification team had sent an email saying that they had additional information that necessitated cancelling the trip to ensure my safety and the car's safety. This email came 10 minutes after the (revised) trip start time. 
I wrote them back and let them know that I had already transferred the car and asked if a needed to do anything. They replied not to worry. The guest was just going through a routine check and that my earnings would not be affected and that no action was required in my part. 

Fast forward to 3:30pm Friday. A knock on my door from a police officer. Great. Now I'd have to hear the dreaded ""I told you so"" from my wife. 

The officer asks if I own the car and proceeds to tell me that they arrested a wanted fugitive in it and I had to pick it up after they were done searching it. I've seen what they do to cars looking for drugs. It's not pretty. Once I got the call to go get it, the cop explained that nothing was broken, but few panels were removed. He ended the call by saying ""good luck, man"". I drove to the location where they left it, which oddly, was at the residence they picked the dude up which was a bit uncomfortable. 

Luckily there was no real damage. I was able to pop the panels back in easily. There were a few personal items in the car that were not mine - a hat, shoes, a bottle of something, some garbage, and a bunch of cigarettes. I left them in the parking lot as I just wanted to be done with this whole thing. 
I did notice that the gas tank was half empty and they had put over 400 miles on the car in under 20 hours. It also smelled like smoke. Annoying, but I used to smoke so whatever. It's over. 

Nope. 

I get home and call Turo to see what to do. There were still two days on the reservation. That was a nightmare. They transferred me back and forth between departments and chat and email after explaining that my car had been used to traffic drugs and the unapproved driver had been arrested. Towards the end of the call, all I wanted was to ensure that the renter could not see my address and info as I had no idea what was going on and who this wanted fugitive was. After two hours of this, someone finally assured me that the renter could not see my info. 

While I was on with Turo support, the lady who rented the car texted me and asked what was going on. I gave her a short version and she asked if I was bringing the car back. I declined. 
She then we went on a whole story about how someone she knows stole the car. 
And now she wants a refund. She put in for a change to the reservation for the one day. I accepted that. 
So now I got a whopping $31 for this which doesn't cover the gas missing from the car and the several trips I made to deliver the car and to recover the car. 
Now she wants me to bring her the personal belongings that I left there. I said no and told her where I left them. I asked her if we could be done at this point. 
This morning I look at the app as they're sending me emails to finalize the trip. So I fill out the form marking $20 for gas and $50 for smoke damage on the reimbursement section. 
Then I get a call from the police telling me to come back down there to pick up the insurance card, registration, and keys. 
So I go down there again and while I'm waiting for the officer to show up, she texts me again complaining about how I charged her an extra $80 and how she wants a refund. It's not her fault. I left her personal belongings in the road. Blah blah blah. 

The officer shows up and gives me my stuff. He then explains how the gentleman they arrested was the most wanted fugitive in the county. I asked if he just had a bag of weed or it was something more. The officer told me they found A LOT (while his eyes got huge) of drugs, pipes, weapons, and stuff in my car. I then asked if I need worry about needles still being in my car. His response was ""be careful"". 

I get home and try to work out with the lady her refund. We came to the agreement that I should be compensated $110. $30 for the day rental. $20 for the gas. $50 for the smoke. 
She said Turo would be contacting me about the refund. I reiterated to them via email that she should be refunded anything beyond my $110 compensation. 
They refunded her out of my $110 compensation. 

So now I get a whopping $46.44 for all of this because their support is so incredibly incompetent. 

To boot, they sent an email finalizing the trip with a nice map of where my house is. 
They also have no regard for the personal safety of their hosts. 

tl;dr
I rented my car on Turo and it was used to traffic drugs. Turo support sucks ass.

TIFU by accidently poisoning my dog,t2_11cqzr,"No she is not dead. She is momentarily at the vet.

I'm an effing dumb bi***.
I feel so much guilt and anxiety i am having panic attacks non stop for hours.

So this happened today. (Fyi I am living with my parents,  so its a family dog). My mother was on a walk with a friend of hers and the dog. I was home alone and watching tv,  when I got up and looked out the window (because it was snowing), then I discovered chewed up bits on the floor with my bag next to it. 
So the chewed up things are not an unfamiliar sight, as my dog is chewing up almost regular something in the house (but not eating anything, just for the sake of destroying it).
But the bag was a new sight, I was standing there thinking what had happened (only for a minute or so), when I realized that I left a package of dark chocolate in my bag a week ago. I was panicking, calling my mother immediatley to tell her what happened and to take the dog to the vet asap.
I was in too much shock to cry then, but I did afterwards. Its just a tiny 12 kg dog, that ate about 40 to 50g of 70% chocolate! 
So I had panic attack after panic attack waiting for my mother to call and update me. I'm cursing myself how dumb I am for leaving the chocolate in reach of my dog. I love this dog more than anything, I dont know what I would/ should do if she... I cant write it.

So the dog got something to throw up, but no chocolate... She (the dog) is in the care of the vet, she got an Infusion. We are waiting now for an update from the vet. 

I inspected the bag, and its still zipped up, so technically the dog couldnt reach the inside of it, but she ripped the little side bag and teared the fabric inside open to get to the contents. Some of the stuff inside was beside the bag, so I think she digged inside the bag to take the chocolate...

I never felt so guilty in my life, or so anxious.

If I am violating any rules, please delete this post, I am just writing to distract myself until the vet calls.

Tl;dr: my dog ate chocolate by tearing up my bag, now she is at the vet and I am having panic attacks because of it.",3
TIFU Getting a kitten,t2_4invjjwc,"Well, Im not sure how I managed this one guys.

For the past week I've been talking to someone about a kitten they had available (their cat had kittens and they couldn't keep them due to landlord's rules)

Anyways, after a lot of back and forth, and meeting the little gal in person, I decided that I would take her home!  
Yesterday was the day, I had been waiting for it for the past two weeks! And what could go wrong?After all, I was going to bring home a new family member!

I went to sleep the day before with anticipation....only to wake up the next day and not remember about what I was supposed to do till today.

I managed to forget the one thing I had to do this week, and now I feel awful. I will now be going back today to pick her up.

Im so sorry for this crime against cat kind.  


TL;DR : I somehow managed to forget to pick up a kitten after two weeks of talking",7
TIFU by leaving my windows cracked at lunch,t2_jqaka,"Obligatory not today, but in my defense reddit wasn't around when it happened, around 2006.  I worked at a shitty call center that I hated doing tech support for directTV.  I signed up for split shifts after a year because they offered 3 dollars more an hour to do it. I assume because the lunch and dinner hours were the highest call volume.   So one day, I finish my morning shift and go home for lunch on a nice spring/summer day.  We usually let my cat outside around this time because he liked to sun bathe.  He never went far, just lay on porch, lawn,  or driveway.   Well I eat my lunch and take a nap. 


Eventually it's time to go back to work and I leave.  Its about a 7 minute drive because it's a bit out of town.  I park.   I arrive 1 minute before my shift.   Then all of a sudden a cat comes through the front seats onto my armrest and stretches out his front paws and yawns.  The little bastard was sleeping in my back seat and I didnt see him.  Mind you, my windows were only down the length of a stretched out hand.  It wasn't until weeks later I saw him in action doing the same thing.  he climbed on me roof and ninja himself through the crack upside down.



The fuckup is, I had to tell my boss I had to go back home because my cat is in my car.  That alone was an awkward story to tell, but since this makes me 20 minutes late it puts me over penalty points and I got fired a few days later.  No big deal, hated that job.



Tl:dr: left windows down, cat snuck in my car without me knowing.   Went to work and he surprised me as I was pulling up causing me having to go take him back home and being 20 minutes late and getting fired.",24
TIFU by exposing my vast drug knowledge to my Dad whilst watching TV,t2_86gnbw5v,"This happened just a few minutes ago. My dad and I had just finished eating and sat down on the couch to watch some TV. 
We ended up watching some Border Patrol and one segment was about three Palestinian guys whose suitcases turned out to be heavier than they should be. The officers ripped up the suitcase lining and pulled out a bunch of long packages, which when cut open leaked curry. We had a quick laugh about how bizarre it is to smuggle curry into a country until they revealed that the curry was just to hide the scent of drugs. Out came the packages and so did the 8kilos of MDMA rocks. My dad looked confused since they hadn’t yet revealed it was MDMA, which is when I blurted out without thinking: “That’s a lot of MDMA!” after which he turned to me with a confused look. 10 seconds later the border patrol tests those beautiful crystals and reveals that, what a surprise, it’s MDMA!! My dad was slightly surprised but didn’t react, saying that those guys are absolute idiots to smuggle drugs for a few thousand dollars. Here’s the second part of my fuck-up, I pulled out my phone and did some quick maths and gave my estimate of how much money those guys could make, telling my dad that it’s definitely not just a few thousand bucks. Fast forward to the sentencing part in court when they revealed the actual street price which was, low and behold, not very far off of my estimate.  
So now I’m sitting here, trying to explain why I know so much about this drug. Oops

TL;DR/ managed to identify and accurately estimate the street price of a bunch of MDMA whilst watching TV with my dad",58
TIFU by playing field hockey without mouth protection,t2_9qoyo9ex,"It wasn’t today but around 2 months ago when I was at field hockey practice. It was before the training and were just shooting some balls as a warming up. I should say that hockey balls are big and round and as hard as stone. I wasn’t wearing any protection because it was before training and what could go wrong...
So a girl in my team passes a high ball to me and i tried to catch the ball with my hockeystick. Well the ball bounced off my stick and directly bounced against my front teeth and they broke down into small pieces. I immediately went to the dentist but my teeth were so broken they couldn’t be restored so here I am now with 3 fake teeth because I thought it was a good idea to play without any protection.

Tl;dr: I was playing field hockey without mouth protection, someone passed me a high ball, ball bounced if my stick and now I lost 3 teeth permanently .",2
TIFU by not keeping my mouth shut at the dentist,t2_8c6bm8ui,"Several years ago I moved and had to find a new dentist. I had 4 cavities I’d been putting off for a while, so the dentist agreed to fill them all at once. The appointment was scheduled for 2 hours, later in the day, after work.

I normally snack on a granola bar every day at work. The store was out of my regular kind, so I’d bought some chocolate banana bars. They were DELICIOUS. I couldn’t help myself, and I ended up eating the entire box.

On my way to the dentist, my stomach was very unhappy. I was extremely bloated. The gas came quickly, and I spent the entire drive pushing out what I could, windows down, sweating. I was getting nervous as I parked, hoping it would stop. That’s when I read the box.

They were FIBER BARS.

But it was too late. The hygienist got me set up in the chair, put the nose piece on for the nitrous, and said she’d be right back. I took that as my final fart break and let loose. The smell was so bad I smelled it IMMEDIATELY, even with the nose piece on. The hygienist came back and did a full stop at the doorway before hesitantly proceeding.

Over the next two hours, I emitted a steady stream of toxic waste. I mean two straight hours of hot silent farts. The dentist seemed weirdly unbothered, but the hygienist excused herself several times. Towards the end, she told him “I’m sorry, I just... I can’t” and didn’t come back. He did the fillings while holding the suction hose himself for most of it.

I was so mortified that I didn’t go back there for over a year. When I finally did, I was hoping they’d forgotten. But as soon as I walked in, the hygienist (who also functions as a receptionist) knew my name. I figured she remembered me due to my horrific gas leak, so I apologized. Turns out she didn’t remember the incident, she remembered me because I drool like a Saint Bernard (this is true, it runs down my face, it gets everywhere). She laughed, I died a little inside.

I really like that dentist, so I decided to leave him a good review on Google. It basically summarized what happened and said they were very professional about it.

At my next visit, my dentist mentioned it immediately, laughing about it. He told me he has no sense of smell. He had no idea it even happened. The hygienist had blamed her leaving on a medical issue or something, and didn’t rat me out.

I should have just kept my mouth shut.

TLDR: Ate a whole box of fiber bars before a long dentist appointment, leaked hot farts the entire time, didn’t go back for a while, figured they remembered, turns out dentist didn’t even know and found out from my review.

Edit: Holy crap, I picked the wrong night to forget to charge my phone and this thing got way more attention than anticipated. I am so happy that so many of you got a laugh out of this. Thank you to the people who pointed out that she was a dental assistant rather than a hygienist, I wasn’t really sure what title to use for her when I made the post. Also, I am female, and a small one at that, which I somehow feel makes this funnier. Keep being awesome Reddit, and shout out to all the people who find farts just as funny as I do!",5348
TIFU by getting blocked by a close friend/coworker,t2_lgy3i,"Today I fucked up by making one of my best friends suddenly hate me and block me on both snapchat and my number.

So shes been having a rough time lately. Shes been extremely stressed out, and emotionally shes been a broken mess for a while. Her last boyfriend and her broke up in march but she has told me about him mentally abusing her. Fast forward to now, that ex is going into the military overseas after promising her he wouldn't, so she talked to him again and said her goodbyes. Even though he abused her, she's known him since kindergarten so shes worried he wont come back and so shes been depressed and crying because she blames herself. 

Now to me, I've been trying to get her to hang out with me for a few weeks, and we haven't hung out still because something always comes up. Usually its depression related, like her not eating all day because she feels so terrible, or her not sleeping because she was up crying all night. She has told me these things, yet when she cancelled on me for the 4th time, I decided to make a joke that I was unfriending her, and that was my biggest mistake. She immediately got pissed, told me I was an asshole for ""threatening her"" even if i was joking, and told me to fuck off before blocking both my phone number and my snapchat. I tried messaging her on social media, and even emailed her apologizing (since we've sent emails before) but I got ignored. 

Now, I had an ex girlfriend who acted a lot like this, and frankly she was just a drama queen who faked all that stuff just for the attention. And honestly I dont know if this is another case of that and I'm being emotionally played with, or if this is a serious thing and I'm just stupid for not being a good enough friend. I just dont know what to do.

TL:DR - Made a joke to my depressed female friend about unfriending her and got blocked from talking to her again.",7
Tifu by talking to a lesbian on Omegle,t2_8fq7y4dw,"So it happened yesterday night, i was having difficulty sleeping so i decided to chat on Omegle(i don't go there a lot). I'm a girl and put my interests as Lesbian, sapphic. Aside from all the bots and horny men i found some really cool girls. Now.. There was this one girl in particular, we started talking. She said she was 17 and from UK. We talked about so many things, made sapphic jokes.
 She was replying well, i was replying well. It was a good conversation. After 45 minutes of talking, when i said i wanted to sleep and said good bye, that girl replied with Good night and told my she was a 25 yo man.

🤦 How dumb of me to actually think i was talking to an actual girl for almost an hour, while it was a man all this while. Just as he said he was a man he disconnected. I FEEL EXPOSED. All my sleepiness vanished in a second. I still am in shock with what happened lmao. I feel so naive right now. So this is how i fucked up

"TIFU by almost got caught ""showing porn"" to kids at church",t2_5j4u0ro2,"Almost got caught ""showing porn"" to kids at church

This happened, around August last year. Thought about submitting then, but then I thought it wasn't an FU enough for here. Saw [THIS ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kupk8o/tifu_by_explaining_to_a_young_muslim_girl_what/) post and reminded me of my experiance.

So my friend from out of town invited me to a family chuch one morning. About 3-5 families and a few singles. Church went as normal. Nothing too special there. We had lunch, then just talked until people felt like they needed to leave. A couple kids who lived in the house was busy coding on Scratch on the public computer. The parents are really carefully on what they can and can't do. No downloads. Can't even use YouTube) So 12 year old (Lets call her K) was trying to convince her younger brother (J, who is 11) that putting your age and school on your scratch profile is a bad idea (which it is), so I show them how to use Grabbify (a free tool to phish for someone's IP address and location). So now the kids are excited, cause they believe that they are hacking and doing cool advanced stuff. 

By this time, a few adults were concerned with this relatively new person in the church being with the kids on a computer, and then they hear things like ""hacking"" being thrown about. 

And now for the FU. I decided to show them an idiot I found online who gave out his city, as well as his age and other social medias that he linked together, painting a rather personal digital footprint. He is also 11, and the is messing around with adult content on reddit, thinking he is anonymous, but I found him. His last post (at the time) was literally called ""Porn."" I had a laugh, and showed it to the kids. (NOT THE POST. JUST THE TITLE), expecting them to have a laugh at him too. Nope, they just said it out loud a good 3-4 times. J admitted he didn't know what it meant, and K was still confused about how someone just blurts out his location on the internet. I'm not sure if any adults looked over, but as soon as J said he didn't know the meaning of the word, I made a fake phone call to walk outside before any adults thought I was showing porn to the kids.

TL;DR. Showed the title of a post called ""Porn"". 11 year old blurts the word out loud near parents.",5
TIFU badly by waking up late.,t2_7htj7xcl,"Generally I never post on reddit, but today I have to. That too in this subreddit. Allow me to vent out. 

So I work in one big multinational company which focuses on client service. Yesterday night at 1:02AM, manager informed on group of sudden roster change and I was in the new roster. That time I was awake and I accepted the roster. I had to report to office by morning 8AM. 

Then a very nice sleep followed by and I woke up directly at 10AM and after waking up I was wondering something is fucked up and then I remembered I had to go office. Checked my phone and there were 50+ missed calls, messages and what not. I did not say anything and went to office by 11:30AM. 

Welcomed very nicely by my team by calling lazy ass and manager called me in his cabin and he gave piece of his mind. I said sorry and promised this will not happen again. But it was too late because manager called another staff because of my unexpected absense. 

Now I am sitting at home for 1 week and that too without pay just because I woke up late. I am not included in this week’s roster till saturday and on top of that, no pay. 

Man. Sleep really fucked me up. Can’t help. I feel very very guilty for my mistake and I haven’t been able to smile in front of my team and at home, my parents.  This really sucks.

TIFU by drunkenly telling one of my coworkers that another coworker likes him,t2_3xip732f,"I feel terrible about this, but let me set a scene for you. Me and my coworker/friend Z are both 18 m. Another coworker of ours M is 17f. We are all friends at the place I work and are all really close. One night, I was out drinking with some friends and M snapchatted me asking me a question. I couldn't really comprehend what she was saying so I told her that I have been drinking and would answer her question in the morning. She asked me if I would remember anything in the morning and I told her most likely no, as I had a decent amount and planned on having more. She then told me that she likes Z, and asked me to keep it a secret. I said I would. This happened about 2 weeks ago. Today M and I were making plans then she said out of the blue ""did you tell Z that I like him?"" I said not that I can recall, as I never really thought of it after she told me. She said that another coworker of ours, J, talked to her about it, and he said that he over heard Z talking about it to other coworkers. I happened to be working with Z, and it was just him and I, and I asked him if he knew anything about it. Apparently drunk me thought it would be a great idea to tell him. It must have happened after I had more booze in me as I have no recollection of it. I apologized profusely to M, as I felt like I took her trust and my promise and threw them out the window. I met up with her about an hour ago to talk it over and we made up, so everything is fine now, but now that I know I did this makes me feel awful.

TL;DR Got drunk, a coworker told me she liked another coworker and asked me to keep it a secret. Drunker me did not. Everything is okay now though",6
TIFU by making old fashioned pop corn.,t2_14yq02,"A while back, I decided to have some popcorn while watching The Mentalist. The only kind I had was the loose kernel kind you have to pop in a pan in a little bit of oil.


I have never done this before but thought it'd be fun and I could make a unique flavor with bacon grease, butter, smoked salt, etc. 


When the oil was ready, it said to put a single layer of kernels in the bottom of the pan. I did that, and 30 seconds later, everything was on fire...


The kernals popped SO fast that they Overflowed out the pan and went all over the stovetop. Even when I took the pan off the heat, they kept popping and flying out and quite a few landed on the burner, immediately bursting into flame. 


So now I'm juggling this still popping overflowing pan while frantically trying to blow out the little popcorn fires when I accidentally blow one onto the counter and up against a roll of paper towels which, you guessed it, also started burning. 


Oh, and I was shirtless, getting peppered with hot drops of grease and oil the whole time. I went from ""Can't wait for some popcorn!"" to ""EVERYTHING'S ON FIRE!!!"" in the span of about 15-20 seconds.


I finally set the pan on the floor, still popping a bit, and a grabbed some tongs to pick up the half enflamed roll of paper towels and tossed it into the sink, dousing it with the sprayer. The popcorn that was on the burner had mostly burned out. Their little fires were short lived but Intense. I blew out the remaining embers, caught my breath, and looked at the smokey remains of my ~~life~~ kitchen.


I saved about a third of the popcorn, what had stayed in the pan. The rest I swept up and tossed. Then I cleaned up the stove, got a well deserved beer from the fridge, and sat down with my snack to resume my show but... it honestly didn't even taste that good. I mean, I still ate it all, but that was mostly out of spite

TIFU by mixing up the names of two indian co-workers who are 20 years apart.,t2_9rrqprxk,"TL;DR: I have 3 indian co-workers, and I referred to one by the name of the other in front of everyone on a Zoom call.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like such a typical ignorant white coworker right now.

I have three indian coworkers at my office.

Bob - 40 year old guy

John - 25 year old guy

Daniel - 25 year old guy

So, on a team meeting Zoom call which included John, Daniel and a few other members of the team, I was telling Daniel about how Bob was working on some files for me.

In the process of doing this, I had referred to Bob as John, and obviously they are distinctly different due to their big age gap alone. Nevertheless, I ended up being \*that\* guy who can't tell POC apart at the office, and I did it on a team meeting Zoom call.

I am a year in working here, and Bob and John (who's names I mixed up) are both the two most recent people I have begun to work with, so I think that is partly why I mixed up the names.

I also happened to have my eyes reading over John's name when I was talking about Bob, so I think I just had that extra influence to make the mix up.

The worst part is that there was already a guy notorious for making this mistake with Daniel and another Indian guy from a separate department, and he was always chided for it behind his back. Welp looks like now thats me.

When it happened, Daniel had begun to hint at my mistake and I quickly and kind of casually corrected myself and continued on to try to not make a big deal about it, but I still know it was noticed.

I'm not sure if I should text John and apologize for the mix up that he witnessed in my and Daniel's conversation.

God I feel like such an idiot.",1
Tifu by spraying an ABC fire extinguisher at a grease fire.,t2_7y76864p,"Wife overheated a pan of grease on our flat top stove. The pan was completely full, I'm talking a full liter of oil. Caught fire, wife panicked a bit, didn't know what to do. By the time I got to the kitchen, the surrounding area was already lit. Papers on the counter, wife's phone, pot holders nearby, all lit. I thought I couldn't just cover it with a towel (towel on the oven handle was on fire) and it had a splatter screen on it which was also on fire. The kitchen is so small, I literally couldn't get to any of the cabinets to get dry powder like baking soda which we didn't have enough anyway. My instinct was to hit it with the extinguisher, so I did.
 
That's when it got turned up to 11. Huge explosion caused by the pressure of the extinguisher spraying oil everywhere. I decided to just spray everything else besides the pan, and everything else went out quickly. Cabinets, range, papers and other misc stuff on the counter were all out, but the oil pan was still burning strong. I didn't know what else to do.
 
So I popped on some oven mitts, picked up the burning pan, and walked outside with it.  Spilled a bit on the floor on the way out. Spilled a bunch on myself, lit myself on fire. Spilled a lot at the door as I basically threw it outside lol. Then got sprayed with extinguisher. Some how miraculously came out with only a burn on my finger, though it's severe. My face and neck was red, and I got a spicy new hair cut, but no other blisters besides the finger. Wearing multiple layers saved me. My pants halfway burned off but my long underwear were only singed. Same with my shirt and thermals underneath.
 
Obviously 3 mistakes here on my part. 1. Not having a working smoke detector to alert us to fire sooner. 2. Using a pressurized extinguisher on a grease fire (it was effective at putting out the surrounding area, but I shouldn't have pointed it directly at the pan, even if from 6 feet away) 3. I shouldn't have even tried to get it outside. I could have killed myself, and I could have spread the fire further through the house making it harder for firefighters. After the explosion, i was right to extinguish everything else, but once it was out I should have then gone and got a towel or blanket to smother the oil. I don't think that was an option from the start, because of the surrounding fire, but once it was all out I should have done that instead. 
 
I'm lucky to be alive, and lucky it was only the kitchen on fire and the rest of the house just has minor smoke damage. I'm feeling really stupid, even though my wife regards me as a hero. I'm sure if I had of just left it and done nothing, the whole house would have burned down. But I'm wishing I made better choices. 
 
Tl;dr: grease fire + pressurized extinguisher = boom. Don't walk with a burning pan. Smother with lid, baking soda, towel or thick blanket.

TIFU by using a fake name to sign up for a free trial.,t2_9s09m,"So I sign up for free trials of tv streaming services sometimes, mainly if there is an event or something I want to see. As a result I make up fake names, email addresses, and use Privacy app to generate cc numbers to ensure I don’t get charged unless I decide to keep the service. The random email was snarfthundercat**@****.com and my first name as Snarf and last name as Thundercat (yes I’m a child of the 80’s). So I had an issue with some of the channels I had ordered so I had to call customer care, not even thinking about the name. Then I got connected with someone from India who asked me to certify my email and such. Then it dawned on me the info I had put. So for the next 15 minutes this nice Indian woman referred to me as Mr. Thundercat or simply Snarf when she wanted to be informal. I really think the name was lost upon her though as she spoke to me without a chuckle, giggle or laugh. I myself must have raised my blood pressure by at least 20 points trying to suppress my laughter though. I could say I would never do this again, but Mr. Thundercat has such a nice ring to it.

TL;DR I used a fake name for tv services and an Indian call center lady had to refer to me as  Snarf Thundercat",3445
TIFU by not knowing the difference between booty call and butt dial.,t2_1x2w5pln,"Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but this fuckup was recent. 

For my entire life, I thought that booty call meant the same thing as butt dial. I have told a large amount of people, including relatives, that I booty called them. I have gotten many strange and disturbed looks after saying this, but for some reason nobody ever corrected me. 

I wish they had, because a little while back, I accidentally called my mom. When she answered the call I apologized and told her that it was a booty call. She was weirded out, which confused me, and my misunderstanding resulted in her spending a good five minutes awkwardly explaining that apparently booty call has a different meaning than butt dial. Whoops.  

TL;DR: I told my mom, several relatives, and many friends that I had booty called them.",1493
TIFU by eating in my room as if I hadn't just moved in and left everything packed and messy.,t2_5tcq4p4p,"Just happened.

My family is nearly done moving. Everyone's rooms are more or less finished except for mine. Boxes and clothes and objects are strewn about because I can't decide where to put what, and it's hard to move around the room. That kind of messy. While I'm slowly getting there I could definitely stand to pick up the pace.

My mom got on me about it some half-hour ago because a relative wants to see our new place tomorrow. Told me to try and finish tonight. I'm like,

&gt;Fine, but not before this can of *sardines*.

You know how you have to pull the lid up carefully because it flicks drops of sardine juice back at you?

I somehow flung the whole fucking can off my desk in the process and there's just sardine juice on a lot of stuff now. Wouldn't have been as bad had I just finished unpacking and putting everything away. At least then I could just mop the floor and wash my bed sheets. But nOoOoOoOo, not on my watch apparently.

I'm putting the sardines in the fridge. I don't even want to look at them right now. Just gonna finish cleaning while I sulk about it.

**TL;DR: There is currently sardine juice on a good portion of my belongings.**",3
TIFU by slicing my buttcheek open,t2_3nk0any9,"Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile!
  
  So today while I was taking a shower, I was shaving my armpits and went to rinse my razor off. I stand with my back against the water and when I rinse my razor I cup my other hand against the razor. I went to rinse it off and I managed to slice my ass with the razor. I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, until I realized that I had gone pretty deep into my skin. 
  After I got out of the shower I took my dads advice and sat with an ice pack wrapped in a washcloth to try to stop the bleeding. It’s now been about an hour and a half and my ass is still bleeding. The washcloth is completely soaked in blood. The worst part about this is that an emergency room or urgent care can’t do anything about this, other than maybe super gluing the skin shut. It isn’t deep enough for stitches, as it’s just an abrasion. I currently have a tight pair of shorts on with gauze against the wound, and it’s only been about 10 minutes since I put it on and the blood has already soaked through. 

Anyone have any advice on how to get it to stop? I can’t use bandaids as the blood would soak through almost immediately. 

TL:DR Sliced my buttcheek open with my razor while I was showering. An hour and a half later and it’s still bleeding.",19
TIFU wedding day,t2_9fwo9p28,"Nice storytime HOW I FELL OUT OF THE CAR :) 

I don't know about you, but in my country, after the church, you go to the wedding hall in a column of cars. As I was in the car that was the first in the column, I had to hold a big flag out the window. Suddenly I put my head and hands out the window so that I literally half hang out of the car and then a bandage comes and I just fly out of the car nicely on my head. I literally heard the skull collide into the concrete pavement. Soon everyone stopped and helped me, in the end the ambulance had to come because a lot of blood was coming out of my head and my arm was broken. About 20 PM I was released from the hospital with a cast in my hand and a few stitches in the right corner of my forehead. and I still go to the party and come  on dinner. I have to admit I was the main star of the evening hahaha.that was 3 years ago and even today it is a hot topic to talk hahahaha

And one of her candles went out and had the wax all up on the sides so she was gonna throw it away, but my mom said that if you put an uneven candle  in a pot of boiling water it'll melt back in place. So I was doing laundry, then heard my sister playing ultimate assassin on my computer, I smiled and joined her like the good ol' days, Did you know flash is going down soon? You should play some of your favorite flash games before they are gone forever, I know you probably know about the flashpoint project (if you don't look it up) And how the games are going to be preserved, but those old websites, the logos, the interface... That's never coming back please cherish those memories remember the good times you ha- Wait I smell smoke I run Straight to the laundry room because that is right next to the guest room here and I smell the smoke clearer. I stop the dryer and washer and check the backs and there is no fire or motor damage, then I go to ask mom and grandmother if they smelled it and then I see it, Thick Black smoke pooling up at the ceiling in the living room, then my eye panned over to the kitchen, So it turns out the microwave above the stove caught all the heat after the pot was out of water and the whole bottom part of it fucking melted, caught fire and dripped down on the stove, flowed under the eye pf the stove (its one of those old electric heated ring ones) caught fire and toasted the cabinets my mom grandmother and I put out the fire and we called 911, they tore out the drywall tossed the stove and threw the burning towels away.

"TIFU By Getting Caught By My Father-In-Law With My Pants Down, Rubbing My Belly",t2_14fpqy,"This happened last week but I’m still mortified. 

My partner and I recently bought a house with some financial help from his parents. They’ve dropped by unannounced a few times since we’ve moved in, usually with some food or other goodies, so it’s not too much of an annoyance. 

Before I continue, I am painfully aware of how lucky/spoiled we are. 

Anyways, we have a half bath downstairs which faces our side door/main entrance. Since I am 9 months pregnant, that toilet is used by me pretty frequently during the day as I would not be able to make it upstairs in time with my overcrowded bladder.

Recently, as my belly grows large, I’ve been leaving the door wide open so I feel I have a little more room to do my business. When I’m done, I like to look at my ever-changing body in the mirror, with my pants still at my ankles. One time while I was admiring my beautiful belly, I hear the side door jiggle and when I look up, I make eye contact with my father in law who is about to walk right in. Instead of closing the bathroom door and hiding like a normal person would have done, I hopped away and ran upstairs all while yelling at my partner to deal with his dad. I hid in my bedroom until he was long gone. My face is burning with heat just writing this. 

TL;DR: father-in-law caught me with my pants down while I was admiring my 9 month pregnant body in the downstairs bathroom because I left the door wide open.",393
TIFU by assuming my boyfriend was cheating on me,t2_43w0oivj,"This happened when we first started dating.

His mobile used to ping and light up when someone texted him and once I saw that someone had texted him with the name ""Babe ❤️"" I didn't think of it as anything and that I had not seen it correctly but next coming weeks I saw it happening many times. He would get really happy when the person texted, used to smile really big and all. I started thinking I was being cheated on, the last straw for me was when the person texted ""love you too"" I confronted him about and he stared at me for some time before he started laughing.

I cried because what the hell, so he calmed me down and explained to me that Babe is his grandmother, her name is Baberuth and everyone in the family called her Babe, she recently had gotten her first smartphone and he had taught her to text, so when she texted it was exciting for him to see her using emojis and stuff.

Never felt so embarrassed in my life. A few months later he took me to meet her and I kid you not, for a 85 year old Babe is a sport. Seeing her punch a guy square in the jaw for harassing was a sight. We are best friends now.

TL;DR I assumed my boyfriend was cheating on me but it was just his grandmother texting him.

TIFU by masturbating and ending up in A&amp;E,t2_303ctbul,"Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but about a year ago. 

So had it not been for COVID, I would’ve had to sit my GCSEs last summer, but I passed most of them anyway. Back to the point, I had mock exams (practice for the real thing) first thing in the morning and all day. 

Me being me, I decided to quickly knock one out as it helps me sleep. All was fine at first, until I started feeling my heart starting to pound and my whole body starting to uncontrollably shake. I started feeling nauseous as well, I just tried to shake it off and get to sleep. But I really couldn’t handle this immense weird feeling I had never felt in my life.

I eventually gained enough courage to go to my parents room and tell them the worrying news. My dad actually has atrial fibrillation (heart suddenly beating too fast or too slow), a few years ago he had an attack but got it sorted at hospital. So it’s fair to say he knows what it feels like to get palpitations and high blood pressure, things like that.

He got up, felt my racing pulse and got us all straight to A&amp;E. 

Just before we left, I desperately tried to get as much man milk out of the little guy before we left to try and calm things down slightly. To no avail.

We arrived at hospital, me feeling very guilty for getting us all out of bed at like 1 or 2am. 

When we eventually saw a doctor, he asked me what I had been doing in bed and I instantly died inside. Especially when my mum started asking me what I was watching on my phone to get me that excited.

It took until the next day for my palpitations to wear off, not before me admitting to my mum that I had a quick wank, hence the general weird feeling. 

I didn’t just admit that, I admitted I did it quite a lot when bored. Thankfully both my parents were absolutely fine just to know I was fine in the end. 

TLDR: decided to put masturbation before education, ended in me admitting my porn addiction to my mum",3
TIFU by popping a HUGE blood blister on my inner thigh at my desk at work.,t2_19aldzwx,"Ok so this is gross and super embarrassing but it was to funny not to share.. 

I have had a painfully huge blood blister or infected boil or something on my inner thigh for about a week or so. It is so big its like a baseball stuck in my leg.  I mean this thing is ANGRY and solid as a stone. I should probably have seen a doctor for the infection at this point but anyway.

I was coming back from the breakroom to my desk. I was the first worker back in the office from break due to me wearing shorts and trying to vape outside in 40°F weather. I'm one of those year round big dudes with shorts on no matter what. I go to sit down and get a jolt of pain. Its the boil. I decide no one is in the office let me take a look at this thing. I roll up my shorts just a little bit to get a peek. It is the most menacing bump I have ever seen. I poke it and it is hot to the touch and at complete max capacity. Not really thinking about it I give it a little squeeze to see how bad it would hurt if I tried to pop it later to release the pressure.... I would not get that chance as the light squeeze was enough to trigger a chain reaction....

It ruptures and squirts a mixture of dark red blood and pus clear across the room. We have an open desk layout no cubicles. Due to Covid19 these desks are spread out 6 ft apart from each other. It clears the neighboring desk with ease and just disappears as I lose focus of the stream of pure evil exiting my body. Blood then squirts all over the floor at my desk, on my hands, on my KHAKI shorts.. I immediately stand up as I hear coworkers Talking and laughing in the hall to the office. A complete panic floods my brain. How the hell am I going to explain all the blood running down my leg to the floor... the blood on my hands and shorts.. There are going to think I'm having some kind of major medical emergency... I look at the splatter on the desk next to me and just know there is no way in hell i can clean all this up before the door opens  ..

I have had an idea ... 

I stuck my hand back up my shorts and just gave the boil a teeth clinching squeeze. I get a absolute disturbing amount of blood all over my hand and run towards the door that the coworkers are coming in. I open it with my shoulder holding one hand up with the other one like I cut off a finger. They all freeze as I run by them covered in blood. I just yell ""I cut my hand on my desk watch out for it!' which thinking back on it don't make much sense but that's the phrase my brain chose in absolute panic. With me busting out the door covered in blood was such a shock I don't think they really even thought about what I said..  We have first aid kits hanging in the main hallway I open it up and grab a handful of Band-Aids and run into the bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize I have like 30 seconds or less till someone comes in here to check on me... I turn the water on and wet my had and look down.. the shorts are a total loss.. but I can get the blood of my leg so I do that. looking down I notice the boil has been squirting blood ever step I have taken... I had probably left a trail like a wounded animal all the way down the hall. I start frantically sticking band-aids to my hand and a few to my leg to stop the actual source of the blood when one of the safety team people walk into the bathroom to see if I'm ok.  I told him ""I cut my hand on my.... scissors ... at my desk and there is blood around it and I trailed it to the bathroom.  I'm fine but I might go to the doctor to get it checked out."" He tells me to go ahead and they will get someone to clean up the blood.. (Sorry to that individual.. sure hope you don't use Reddit...)

The charade worked. I have now pushed off all consequences of my actions today until tomorrow... 

 TLDR: Busted a discussing boil full of blood at work and had to lie that I cut my hand to try to get out of the embarrassment of explaining what really happened.",31
"TIFU by completely flipping my lid, breaking a stick, and berating my own mother for the way she's been treating her new dog.",t2_7kqzqrdz,"So, to start off, I'm a fairly quiet person; I keep to myself, I (unhealthily) bottle up a lot of those nasty feelings, and I usually just try my best to stay out of things, but that usually just ends up in me losing my patience and then blowing up, especially when it comes to my family. My family is dysfunctional, stubborn, and (not to be sexist, I promise) the women will ***ALWAYS*** gang up against whatever unfortunate soul decides to breathe wrong in their presence.  


So, on to where I fucked up... Well, my mother has the patience of a spoiled toddler, and will snap and get mad at just about anything that is a mild inconvenience to her sedentary and self-indulging lifestyle. Makes me wonder sometimes why she even bothered to have/keep me, and why she bothers to get animals that need to be trained so they know commands and/or what not to do. So, she recently got a puppy not even a month after our previous girl passed, and I wasn't too happy about it, but I wasn't about to stop her. This puppy is very spoiled, has little to no training, and has enough energy to act as a generator for my neighborhood. She's been an inside dog for a good bit now, and occasionally has an accident or two in the house, I mean... It's understandable. She's just a pup, and she still needs to learn, but my mother is just like ""OH MY GOD! FUCKING DOG! NO! OUTSIDE!"" pretty much dragging to poor girl out by the collar, stomping her way over to the little puddle, cleaning it up, and then yelling at the pup to go to bathroom outside, but she won't because all of it was on the very-easy-to-clean tile-floor.  


The pup tends to get into quite a bit of trouble when left unsupervised. Let's say we leave her outside for a little bit to go to the bathroom or something, yeah? Well, she'll start digging in the garden, getting under rabbit hutches, chewing up dead leaves and tree bark, and eating things she probably shouldn't. Rather than taking the time to teach the dog, my mother will chase her. Pup doesn't know any better, thinks she's playing, and will run away with whatever new toy or snack she managed to pick up. So, what really got my blood boiling is when I saw my mother chasing the poor dog with a stick, swinging it at her, yelling at her, being an all-around bitch with anger-management issues, and I was having none of it anymore. I went down there, took the stick, broke it into little pieces, and threw it right over the fence. Yeah, she didn't like that. She started yelling at me, asking why I did that, raising her tone as if I had just done the worst thing she could possibly imagine, and, when it comes to my family, thanks to the years and years of abuse I've had to endure, the limit to the shit I can put up with is riiiiiiight above 0. Maybe 0.02. The more she yelled, the more I found myself yelling. The more she talked over me, the more I found myself telling her to ""shut up and listen."" I made a mistake, I didn't stay calm, I let her push me over the edge, and she ran with it, trying to pull the ""parent card"". I yelled, and yelled, and yelled, berating her for not actually training the dog to do anything, but instead teaching her to be afraid, abusing her into obedience. It didn't feel good, but I couldn't stop. Every word I said just pulled more out with it. I even said ""listen, princess, nobody is going to cater to your every need and make sure you don't get hurt."" ... It's not like I've never fought with her, but I've never gone this far. I've never had a reason to tell her that she doesn't just refuse criticism, but she takes it as a full-on attack. She pretends like everyone is out to get her, like everyone wants to blame her for something, and it's fucking annoying. I told her it was annoying... I told her that ***she*** was annoying... I said way too much, and now she's doing the usual silent-treatment, actively avoiding me, not even bothering to look my way. Feels like she doesn't want me to exist, and sometimes I wish I didn't either, but tough shit. She never wants to admit she's wrong, so when she's told that she is, she doubles down, refuses to admit fault, and then pouts because ""*ThEy WeRe MeAn To Me*!""  


I'm 24, jobless, friendless, a failure, and I have no right doing this shit when I am basically an overgrown dependent. I could get kicked onto the street at a moment's notice, and so I've been treading lightly, but this was the final fucking straw, man... I'm scared that I may not have a home if I cross another line like that, but I couldn't just say nothing. I'd be enabling her to keep doing the same shit, and I didn't want to be responsible for that. Funny enough, she's been treating the dog better now, but I shouldn't have had to risk everything just to change that.  


  
tl;dr I fucked up by breaking the stick my mother used to try and punish her puppy, and ended up letting 24 years of pent up frustration flow out of my mouth, potentially putting my living situation at risk. Something had to be done, but I fear that I could have finally crossed the line.",15
TIFU by sitting on the toilet for too long,t2_39r55wi1,"So this happened a year ago. I was invited to my buddy’s place for a little get together. I don’t usually attend but wanted to be a part of the festivities that everyone talks about at work. I decide to go and after eating a few things I needed to sneak away to take a shit. I find a bathroom down the hall so I sit and scroll through apps on my phone. About 30 minutes later I feel my leg tingling so it’s time to get up. I clean myself up and go to pull my pants up. I take one step and my leg is FULLY asleep. I lose my balance and go crashing into the bathtub. I rip down the shower curtain and rod. Everyone comes rushing in to help me up. I’m a bigger guy. Every friend group has one. The funny fat guy. Everyone makes a few jokes and even a few at work for a couple of weeks. Then the pandemic hit and we all started working from home. No more jokes about the incident. Perfect for me. 

Well today my buddy sends me a picture of him helping me out of his bathtub with my pants halfway around my ass. I had almost forgotten about it. I asked where he got the pic? He said that one of the other people at the party snapped a pic and since Apple now does this thing where they highlight a picture you’ve taken on this day, that person sent him the pic. I thought the whole thing had blown over but there I was, ass up, wrapped in a shower curtain in my buddy’s bathtub because my leg fell asleep. 

My take away is fuck Apple for reminding me about this shitshow of a day from last year.

TL;DR I sat on the toilet too long and my leg fell asleep. I fell into a friends bathtub and someone took a picture of it.",20
TIFU by selling my car I now need,t2_mkcmcwm,"This just happened today and we’re still in a little disappointment. Two years ago my aunts husband (no relation but out of respect we call her aunt) passed away and she had no one. She has no kids, her nieces and nephews don’t talk to her and her step kids literally tricked her into thinking that she owns nothing of her late husbands belonging and took all of their dads belongings. They tried to take more but she stopped talking to them.

My wife and I helped her out a lot, mowing the grass, maintenance around the house, take her to sell at the flea market, dr, etc... without ever asking for payment of any kind. One day she comes up me as I was cutting grass and asked if I want her late husbands truck. 2011 Chevy diesel with 32k miles. I was hesitant and shocked but obliged and said yes. 

She gives me the title and bill of sale and got everything transferred. I have a car that I don’t use anymore so I decided to sell it today. Well, she calls and says she needs the car and boat back. W...T...F... I explained I just sold my car and I’d be carless. She said her step kids want to take her places etc and need the truck and she didn’t want to be stuck in the middle.

My wife and I were in total disappointment because we never saw her doing something like this. She just said that she needs the car back by summer so I’m actually going to give it back this weekend along with the title. 

Now I’ll be carless until I can find something.

TIFU by trying to make my son finish a bite of food,t2_xnkwd,"So... This just happened about 10 minutes ago.

Sitting at the kitchen table eating lunch with my son (2.5) and daughter (4).  We all had sandwiches.  My son finished his and asked for another, and knowing he would take one bite and be done, I talked him into a bite of mine instead.  It was the same turkey, salami, and cheese sandwich he had except mine had mayonnaise. (Duke's, of course)

He started chewing and almost immediately mumbled through the bite that he didn't like it.  I proceeded to tell him he needed to finish the bite.  He tried to spit it out but I told him not to and he tried to continue chewing.

Well.... he legit didn't like it because he started gagging and proceeded to vomit on himself.

One bath later and all is well, but instead of me teaching him a lesson, it feels more like he taught me one.

TL;DR  Two year old son took a bite of my sandwich and didn't like it.  Told him he had to finish the bite and he threw up.

Edit: He asked for the same sandwich today, ate the whole thing, and again asked for another.  So......yeah, I made him another and he ate the whole thing.  Sometimes you just have to trust their judgement.  Thanks for all the comments and stories!  My wife and I have enjoyed reading them.",909
TIFU by leaving my camera on,t2_9r1qag81,"Ok so, basically, my college roommate (f22) and I (f22) are very close. Neither of us really have homes to go to outside of college, and we both have decent jobs that we do during the summer and part-time during term that can be done from home and pay the rent, so we basically live together full time. This is great because I got to spend lockdown with my best friend. Except...we're not just friends any more. In May of last year, we started....canoodling, with each other. Due to the fact both of us thought we were straight until that precise moment, we're taking it very slowly, ad neither of us have told anyone. 

Anyway, we were both in a zoom tutorial at the end of last semester- it was a last minute study session and everyone was kinda stressed, so most people had their cameras off. While it was happening, my roommate started rubbing my back, in the way she does when she wants attention. I put my arms around her, and kissed her on the lips. She didn't reciprocate, and I started to panic that I'd misinterpreted her signal, and then I realised the camera was on. 

Luckily, the professor was relatively decent about it (he told us to pay attention, but not in a shouty way, and he called out one of the guys who was being gross and horny about it in the chat), but EVERYONE SAW- including friends of ours who had until that moment assumed we were friends. There was also a bi girl who had tried to date me pre-pandemic, who I'd told (truthfully, at the time!) that I was straight. 

Luckily, I can laugh about it now but it was an incredibly embarrassing moment and it took a long time until I could think about it without cringing.

TIFU by sniffin' on straight chlorine,t2_84qtahse,"To be honest with you, I've always been a lazy person when it comes to breakfast. I usually skip it altogether and just eat when I'm actually hungry, but today I got the idea - what if I just eat some yoghurt with some oatmeal and seeds etc.?
Yeah...Great! So, this is where the fuck up starts.
So, here I am, just pouring some yoghurt in a bowl, and looking for the rest of the ingredients. My SO's family got us bunch of oatmeal, flaxseed, sunflower seeds and a couple of jars with teas and stuff the other day (they are the type to give you something 'cause ""you will need it!""), so I have a fair choice.
One of the jars contained tiny, white granules, which were kind of transparent under the kitchen light.
-Oh, this could be sea salt! Mmm, when was the last time we got this? Let's open it and inhale the smell of mermaids' kingdom!
As I opened the jar, my nostrils that looked forward to smell the ocean, almost ruptured in shock and disappointment. That sharp, kind of sulfury vapor even made insides of my mouth taste like a pool as I inhaled it.
I closed the jar immediately and shoved it back in the kitchen cabinet. With a slight pulsating headache, I still had my breakfast.

TIFU by getting fed up with my noisy neighbor and breaking a part of my window,t2_2lp8l5qh,"For context, I live in a barangay in Manila. Barangays are the smallest administrative district in a Local Gov't Unit, and usually the oldest barangays have houses that are really close to each other, usually either separated by a firewall or just a couple of meters of clearance, in this case it's the latter. This is because the lot we had was divided into two, with a small path in the middle for both houses, neighbors are my relatives that we don't talk to much anymore. Lastly, I have jalousie windows.

I didn't have any issues with the noisy neighbors back then, but ever since the pandemic started, and I'm always in the house, specifically in my room, it has become really annoying. I'd wake up at 2-3am with my neighbor talking to someone on the phone and it's obnoxiously loud, aside from that there's his brother that does rants in the middle of the night like some child on a tantrum. It's as if there aren't any people sleeping. This was the case back in March 2020 up to now. 

This morning I had enough, I tried shouting indirectly about letting people sleep and how noisy it was, that
 didn't work, it's like he didn't hear anything. Then my dumbass self banged on one of the glass panes on the window, I didn't expect I'd hit it hard enough for it to break in the middle, with the shards falling to the path in the middle. The pathway was for the inner residences at the back of the lot, I was lucky too that it was early in the morning so there aren't any people passing by. That
 he did notice, and we had an argument. After I cooled off I calmly talked to him again to tell him to tone down when it's night time, he understood (hopefully). Patched up the hole in the window with a cintra board the size of the broken jalousie glass.

Tl;dr: After months of tolerating my angry neighbor I got fed up and broke my window by banging on it because I was trying to get him to shut up.",3
TIFU by getting rid of my christmas tree,t2_u3uovzm,"Bug warning. 

So it’s time. Having the tree up any longer would have made me feel lazy and pathetic instead of full of holiday cheer, and it’s starting to drop needles, so I start on the process of removing ornaments and garlands to get rid of the tree.

I take off most of the ornaments and start on the garlands. On garland two I see a few stick bugs that run back into the tree. Eh, it’s from a forest, a few are normal. NBD.

I go to get the next garland and accidentally shake the branch, and then six- six!- tiny bugs fall onto the table next to the tree. I freeze. 

Wait. Those are not stick bugs. I look closer.

I had assumed stick bugs cause the only ones I’ve ever seen are very tiny and sway when threatened in an attempt to “move with the wind.”

These are swaying but they are not stick bugs. I look closer.

They are baby praying mantises.

Oh no.

I know praying mantises are supposed to be large. These are not large. These are /tiny/. Which means somewhere on this tree—

I look back at the tree, and realise what I previously thought was a stubborn pinecone is not, in fact, a pinecone, and is /erupting with baby praying mantises/. Hundreds. 

Oh, fuck me.

I ask my spouse, “Do you care about these lights?” 

“No,” he says in confusion.

“Great. Come here and help me get this into the tree bag, we got some bugs.” I am speaking dead calm. “And can you get me a vacuum?”

He’s cooking. He does not understand the severity of the situation. The tree is moving only it’s not, it’s just the /amount of praying mantises shifting on it/. “In a second.”

I do not have a second.

I get the vacuum. I vacuum the nest right off the tree, and then attempt to get every praying mantis that I can see in some bizarre parody of Ghostbusters. 

“No really. We need to get this tree /into the bin bag/,” I say, calm as fuck, which is wild cause inwardly I am screaming cause I have the creepy crawly sensation all over my skin.

“Okay, okay,” he says. He comes over and holds the tree. 

I duck under to loosen the screws. Six fall on my head and neck. I shake them off and keep unscrewing. I feel them anyway. They live in the sensation on my skin now.

We get half of the tree in the bag when we smell smoke. The oil he was heating in the pan is about to catch fire cause he “wasn’t expecting this to take that long”. He rushes back to the kitchen. Somehow he has not had a single bug on him. I am left holding up the tree with no free hands to swat the ones parading down my arms toward my face. I blow them off of me like Gimli trying to blow away ghosts in the mountain.

He comes back. We finally get the tree in the bag and the bag to the tree disposal area for our apartments. I come upstairs and vacuum again, playing ghostbusters along the walls and ceiling where they are swaying. I start to feel a little bad. Not their fault they were born in my house. Still gonna vacuum them though.

Go about my day attempting to ignore the crawling sensation.

Come back to the room a few hours later. There are six on the wall. Ask husband why he didn’t vacuum them. 

He /couldn’t see them/. They are so small that unless he got super close he only saw smudges because his prescription is out of date!!! No wonder he wasn’t freaked out!!! 

TL:DR: Tree infested with bugs, I was the only one who got freaked out cause my husband needs new glasses.",17
TIFU by slicing my thumb open on one of the dullest kitchen utensils ever to be conceived by men,t2_5wfcmsj1,"For starters, This wasn’t necessarily today, instead it was last night. I’m also on mobile so excuse any errors. Now onto the story

Last night I was attempting to make a pot pie completely from scratch, I had also just recently gotten what I’m going to call a “pastry blender” (one of its uses is cutting chunks of butter into a dough, like the one I was making, at first glance, it looks like brass knuckles that have been elongated and have been given the slits of a fork) It started out relatively good, I was using the pastry blender as I had assumed the best way to use it, grabbing it by the handle and slowly mashing the butter like you would potatoes with a potato masher, eventually the blender got jammed up with a lot of butter, and so I put my thumb in it and slided the butter off, nothing happened so I kept doing that when it got clogged, eventually right as I did it I felt a sharp sudden pain in the crease of my thumb, I looked down and saw that I had managed to cut myself on one of the right angles of the long slits in the blender, as well as blood. I lifted my thumb and saw that I had cut a moderate depth into it. I then washed and put pressure on it 

TLDR: Ya boi done messed up by slicing his thumb open on an object more than his brain

Edit: Just tried cooking the same dish again, and sliced off the tip of my finger. Starting to think 2021 has it out for me lol",9
TIFU by attempting to walk across a midden,t2_55t7qgi7,"TIFU by trying to walk across a midden

So obligatory, this didn’t happen today, but yesterday evening. 
I work at a horse stable, and I was doing the the evening chores, which includes feeding the horses and leading them to their stalls and so on.  
As I was finishing up, I got really hungry and I wanted to go home quickly, so I got am absolutely genius idea. The idea was that I could save precious time by walking across the midden to get to the stable instead of walking around the midden, which is an ever so slightly shorter route. 
If anyone doesn’t know what a midden is, it is the place where all the horse shit is placed, and it is usually solid, but! I forgot the fact that we’ve had so much rain here in Denmark lately that the midden basically is one large shit and pee puddle. Not. Nice. 
Anyway, I stepped right into it, believing that I was a genius. That feeling quickly went away as I realized I was knee deep in liquid horse poo. I had to a 30 minute car ride home, and the car smelled like literal shit, and I highly doubt that my pants and boots will ever become properly clean again

TIFU by forgetting about the 3/5s compromise,t2_37oe31wi,"Obligatory- this happened a couple weeks ago. Also on mobile so if there are any formatting errors I will try to fix them.

For those of you who aren't familiar, in short, the 3/5s compromise was a period in American history where the the South wanted their slaves to count as votes (despite not having the right to vote so essentially the slave owners would get a ton of votes). The North obviously didn't want this, so it was decided that each African American would count as 3/5 of a person for voting purposes.

Two things to know about me- 1. I am a very introverted person and 2. I am a white woman who is engaged to a Native American smartass.

Now, my fiance and I were in the kitchen and I was talking with my mom about being introverted. The conversation went as follows

Me: It's really tough for me to be around people because they are absolutely exhausting.

Fiance: *sad puppy dog eyes* you find me exhausting?

Me: You don't count as people (fellow introverts, I'm sure you'll understand!)

Fiance: No, just 3/5s right?

Me: Exactly.

You guys. I walked my ""the beacons are lit, Gondor calls for aid"" white ass right into it. It took me about 0.2 seconds to realize what I had just agreed to and immediately exclaim ""WAIT, NO, NO, NO!"" but this man was already cackling so hard he couldn't talk and I then had to explain to my very confused mother what had just happened.

TL;DR: I, a white woman, was explaining how being introverted affected me and inadvertently agreed to the premise that my minority fiance only counted as 3/5 of a person due to a brief memory lapse of American history.",98
TIFU by going to the car wash,t2_558xj86a,"So, I've had my car for a year and a half now but never washed it before today. I usually let the rain or snow rinse off whatever dirt gets on it. Today, I got tired of all the salt buildup on it and took it to the automatic car wash. I pull in, the sprayer arms start doing their thing, I'm sitting there watching the suds, when I look in the rearview mirror and see water POURING IN through the back windshield!

Turns out the old weather seal can't stand up to the pressure of the car wash, and I found out the hard way. And of course, I can't stop the car wash, so all I could do is sit and watch the water keep coming in. Back of the car and everything in it is soaked, and now tomorrow I have to find a way to get any leftover water out despite it being freezing outside... This is what I get for finally taking care of my vehicle, I guess.

TL;DR - Washed my car for the first time, back windshield leaked, car and its contents are now soaked

Edit: It's a 2003 CRV with 225K miles. It hasn't been a daily winter driver of mine until this season, and a real daily driver at all until this summer, so it hasn't gotten salty or otherwise dirty until this winter.

TIFU OVERSHARING,t2_9imlcacg,"TiFu It all started over 4 years ago, when I overshared about an affair I was in, I wasn't the one in the relationship, I wasn't the one who initiated it, but love is love and I believe I was in love, but unfortunately I shared about my affair with some people who I was really close to but I didn't mention anyones name, but they went on my Facebook(I know its so dumb) and the next day they were like ITS SUCH AND SUCH and I was just like hell no nervously I guess. And I guess they always assumed. But 4 years went by and about 2 years ago in a manic episode I guess I went kind of crazy on my buddy, and wasn't to nice. But now 2 years later and another manic episode later. I was being super paranoid and figured I would touch base with them again after fucking my life up in every other way imaginable. And BOOM they brought it up. At first I just said I lied about it all together, then it turned into a lady I had met online, and then I told them ""who it was"" but I lied about it. Im just worried about them telling who they assumed something even though they still don't have concrete evidence. We are all grown, they don't nessecarily have contact or a relationship with the people in said affair. But its a small town. I dont know if I am being paranoid, would yall not say anything not having any evidence. I am just so scared. I dont want to ruin my lovers life or her family. I think I am just being paranoid. I know this is probably a poorly constructed ramble. 

TL/DR I slipped about an affair I was in but never mentioned names, reconnected with freind 4 years later and they brought it up, and my story changed a couple times but still never fessed up. Im just so paranoid and scared.",5
TIFU for eating late at night,t2_8vgtmy9i,"So I was home alone all night. I got lazy to prepare dinner, so that's why even if I'm hungry, I decided to sleep without eating.

However, when my parents arrived at 10pm, they bought me a take out which consists of a huge serving of burger and 12"" pizza. Since I'm hungry, I ended up eating too fast, and I choked. Unfortunately, the water dispenser is empty, and I have no choice but to change the bottle while choking! At this point, I'm surprised I didn't pass out while doing that because it is freaking dangerous.

But my suffering doesn't end here. Now, I can't freaking sleep because I got upset stomach. I've been going back and forth to the toilet to poop. My ass freaking hurt already, and I don't think I'm done. I'll probably have two more trips later.

Nope, not yet done. The toilet fucking stinks. We also ran out of air freshener. Thankfully, I used the toilet downstair (all rooms are upstairs) so no one can smell it. But my main concern is the pungent smell has reached the living room, and I fear that it might stay the whole freaking night. 😭

TIFU by telling my DoorDash driver I was lonely,t2_9ecqxdeq,"TL;DR: I texted my DoorDash driver to get me some cigarettes, then meant to text my ex how lonely I am without her but neglected to check the number before hand and ended up texting him instead. OOPS 😬

Well today, I broke up with my girlfriend and I was pretty upset with it. Still am, still will be for a while. Anyways, even though I had previously quit cigarettes, I had downloaded DoorDash to order MORE cigarettes (since my ex kept the car and I have no way of getting to the store efficiently), well that’s where our story begins, ladies and gentlemen.


I had ordered a lollipop because cigarettes aren’t on the DoorDash menu, I proceeded to text the driver and tell him that I wanted him to pick up cigarettes. He said sure. As toxic as it sounds, I’m still texting my ex because truth be told, without her, I’m lonely. Not that I don’t enjoy my own company, but I have 0 friends and 0 hoes. With that being said, I proceeded to text her how I’m lonely and miss her. WELL, I didn’t check the number and it ended up being the DoorDash driver. How embarrassed lol Aye, at least he knows it’s hard for a pimp out here 😂 

A wise man once 

“Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back, after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho. And you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then... suddenly she's not your ho no mo'.”

TIFU having mom shout Cellulite,t2_7ngdb85e,"TIFU this was Christmas of 2020. So like a few weeks ago. 

Here's some context. I go with my mom, and step-dad to my step dad's mother's house. She has a tiny get together. Doesnt really follow covid regulations, I know. Regardless, I'm sitting on a chair, and I'm texting my mom about whatever. (I probably only went to my ""step grandmothers"" house twice in 2020) 
Well, my step cousin comes in with his girlfriend. Not to sound rude but her legs are treetrunks. And look like cottage cheese. I forget her name, because me and my mom refer to her mostly as cellulite. 
I text my mom: ""Hey whats cellulites name? Is it Kalliy"" (Thank god I intentionally misspelled it, I thought that would be funny for some reason) she reads the text, and I expect her to laugh. 
Instead she yells, "" WHOS CELLULITE"" while the person I was talking about is near us. Thankfully, no one heard. 
My mother then says ""Oh you're talking about (blank)"" my friend. I have no idea why she mentioned my friend, but she I guess she saved it. She then puts her hand over her mouth, and we begin to laugh for ten-twenty minutes about the whole thing. 
Originally she was going to also say ""Whos Kalliy?"" If she would've said that then I am certain someone would've picked up on it. Because cellulite's actual name is Katie. 
I know that sounds means how I was insulting a family member, but I still think the whole situation is hilarious.

TIFU by agonizing over why he won’t come with me,t2_8fv5pn4h,"TIFU by agonizing over why I will have to solo a mission. It’s not his fault. I have issues. But sometimes talking about it helps, and since there’s nobody else to talk to but the Internet, here’s a howl into the void.

I have to make a time-sensitive trip to Colorado for a family matter. Yesterday I invited my SO of two years to come with me, because we have gone before and it was fine. Today, he said he doesn’t want to go and said he wants to wait for his relief check to arrive. I just can’t believe that’s the reason why he doesn’t want to go. That’s the whole fuck up. I’m mental and hurting.

I’m older than he is by 13 years. He’s expressed interest in other women, not that that’s anything unusual these days. I’m not exactly cute or ideal and I’m used to being a proverbial mouse in the corner in person. I’m telling myself it wouldn’t matter if he stays and sleeps around because there’s nothing preventing him from doing that whether I’m in town or not.

I cried over this like a moron. Even if he didn’t sleep around, this is time he doesn’t want to spend with me and I hardly get to see him as it is with the way my work schedule (and present back injury) have screwed our circumstances. That’s a 40 hour round trip drive, *easily.* It doesn’t exactly sound exciting to me either, but I feel like I am breaking at the thought of going without him.

I can’t sleep, but I’ve taken Tylenol PM and melatonin and Zyrtec to help with that. I don’t know what to do with myself. What if he’s done with me and he just hasn’t said it yet? How do people move on for the umpteenth time after building your life around someone with whom you’d thought a connection existed?

I struggle to do things for and by myself because the self-hatred runs deep. Without him, all the joy is gone from life and there’s nothing left to look forward to or work toward. He knows how I feel about him and I thought he felt the same... but he would rather stay at his cousin’s house waiting for a check that might not arrive, playing video games and smoking distillate, than be in my company. I guess I get it. If I had a choice I wouldn’t be with me either.

"TIFU by hitting a toddler in the head with a swing, TWICE",t2_652xordi,"For some background: In Autumn, the have this farm kinda thing that opens up. They have the typical kind of things, like pumpkin patches, corn mazes, kettle corn, that kind of stuff. At this farm, they have a swing at a top of a hill. The swing connects to a tree branch, and leads to the ground by the hill. Also by the hill is a small stream (you would have had to have been there to really get it).

The Cast: Me, my friend D, and a random lady, who I will call RL.

This takes place about 5 years ago, I was probably about 10. Me and D really wanted to go on the swing, so we got in line. I go on once, and I love it. So I get back in line to try it again. But as I get to the front of the line, there is a lady getting some kids out of the way of the stream (I'm pretty sure the kids were triplets, probably toddlers). 

At this point, it's my turn to get on the swing, so I hop on and push of the hill. But as I'm heading down on the swing, on of the triplets runs back to the stream. I try to stop or swerve around the kid, but I am too late. The swing smacked the kid right in the head, causing him to fall into the stream. As the swing starts to swing back, however, the kid gets back up. The swing then hits the kid in the back of the head, knocking him over again. 

At this point, the lady runs over, and takes the kid away, while the kid is screaming bloody murder. Some other lady runs over, and we have this conversation:

RL: ""Why did you do that!?""

Me: ""I don't know! I tried to stop!""

RL: ""Yeah, sure.""

Me and D walk away, talking about what happened. I look over and see the kid with his family, getting patched up. 

I feel terrible about what happened. I could've caused that kid seriously bad, permanent, head problems. I probably also killed any love for swings he had.

TL;DR I smashed a kid in the head with a swing, TWICE, probably causing serious head problems.",5
TIFU by practicing good dental hygiene before giving a blow job.,t2_43ta8acw,"This happened less than an hour ago. It’s been a really nice, relaxing Saturday, the kids are out of the house, it’s quiet, I’m relaxed and  feeling frisky. Because I’m a marijuana smoker and my husband is not I decided to brush my teeth before putting the moves on my man. My husband bought me this great electric toothbrush for Christmas (I asked for it, it’s not like he bought me a toaster) so I’m taking my time scrubbing every crevice between my teeth. I’m a little high, it’s kind of chill. I then decide to use mouthwash, cuz ya know, I wanna make out. I spit and rinse and strut my way to the bedroom. 

I do a little booty jiggling to obtain my husbands attention, strip down and straddle him, we’re making out, it’s going great.  I shimmy down his strong, sexy bod, seductively look up at him and then I started to confidently and expertly blow him.

Now, please allow me to brag for a moment: I’m amazing at blow jobs, and I genuinely enjoy giving them, I feel sexy, powerful, it’s fun. So I’m enjoying myself, doing my best to make him feel good and suddenly my husband jerks back and winces. I’m thinking that I accidentally got him with my teeth, but he looks concerned. 

With the revelation that his dick was stinging and... cold? He hops up and grabs a T-shirt, wraps it around his dick and hops form leg to leg. About 3 minutes later it’s not getting better, he says it feels like I lubed him up with icy-hot. I’ll be honest here, I couldn’t stop laughing. I felt bad, but it was funny and it’s a sort of uncomfortable situation, I’m a dork that laughs when they’re uncomfortable, so I attempt to apologize to the poor guy  between laughter. He ends up wiping himself up with warm water and it starts to stop feeling like he had menthol on his penis.

I drink a bunch of water and rinse my mouth out a few times and we finally cuddle up and get back to it with no further issues. He thought it was pretty funny too and I think this will end up as an inside joke for us next time we need toothpaste.

TL;DR: by brushing my teeth really well with my awesome new electric toothbrush and rinsing with mouthwash before giving my partner a blow job causing him to feel like I had lubed his dick with icy hot.",95
TIFU I asked about a controversial topic and humiliated myself,t2_67mj2szr," Tldr at the end

So to give some background. I don't take medication.

What's that you have a killer headache? Fight through till you sleep it off. What's that you have an abscess? Fight through it till you pop it and suck it clean or you sleep it off.

Well based on my good ol' I'd rather refuse medication and suffer technique.. My big brain decided to ask for advice on getting the corona vaccine.

I am by no way an anti vaxxer but the more I typed the more I read a meme where I was the anti vaxxer. I self humiliated myself into realisation that simple pills if you will are not the same as the vaccines I so willingly took in school to keep me safe from bigger threats.

I feel horrible, ashamed and humiliated.. I'll try to revert what I have done but I needed to confess my fuck up while it was fresh.

TIFU by not taking piles seriously,t2_9r3t4c5j,"TLDR: Went on a celebratory major city break and, somehow got piles a few days prior to leaving. Ended up leaving a heritage museums bathroom in a bad way. 

So, this didn't happen today however, I think the dust has settled and enough time gone by that it is safe to post also, my partner, let's call her Lupita, still isn't aware of this. 

Last year, it was a big birthday for myself so Lupita treated me to a major trip away to NYC, a first for me and her.  Unfortunately for me, a few days prior to leaving Istarted to experience a bit of pain when going to the toilet and in general (sitting down, walking etc).

Having never dealt with anything like piles (little hemorrhoids/lumps and bumps in and around the butt hole. Particularly discomforting 10/10 would not recommend) before, I did what any rational male would do... Ignored it. Refusing to believe it may be because I'm getting older and, hoped I would be somehow cured in time for our trip away by doing absolutely nothing.

The trip comes around, involving a drive of a few hours to get to the airport...Great. Rather uneventful, just the odd jiggling around to get comfortable. Then the flight...8 hours of trying to balance on one cheek to ease the discomfort.

We get there, the first few days are pretty typical of what has now become the norm...Uncomfortable pain in whatever activity I'm doing however, once in a lifetime trip, you're gonna just get on with it right?

One day we head to a heritage museum after a particularly long walk (FU PT 1). Literally 10 minutes in to a 3 hour museum trip (thankfully unguided) I get a weird sort of medicinal smell and feel like I've got a super sweaty butt. After a couple of comments from Lupita about it smelling like sweaty feet (I hope my feet don't smell like that) I proceed to walk behind her while trying to give everyone else in there (luckily it was quiet) a gap of about 3 meters.

After pretty much the full tour, made my excuses and headed to the bathroom. Just as I thought, one/multiple of the piles had burst. There was so much blood. As in I'm not sure how I didn't feel faint kind of amount. I proceeded to try and get rid of as much as possible in one of those odd, the bottom of the door is pretty much in line with my manhood American bathrooms. At the thought of being seen with my trousers down while wiping at a severely bloody butt, I speed wiped to clear up as much of the monstrosity as possible, in my haste forgetting to flush as I went (FU PT 2). This did not sit well with the toilet as I flushed and the ever rising tide looked like it was going to rush over the top of the bowl like the ever growing tide of shame was washing over me. Thankfully it stopped and just sat there, settling enough to look deep in to my eyes through the reflection and question who I a really am as a person. My action may not be deemed as valiant or brave, more cowardly....trousers up, wash hands...run away. 

I am hoping that if someone is watching over me, I am not solely judged on my actions that day.

A word of warning, if this happens to you, get yourself checked out. Ignorance is not bliss...it is painful and smells kinda weird.",15
TIFU- By eating a Caesar salad and going for a run,t2_32b9e,"

Obligatory- NOT today. I promised my kid I'd wait until he was at least 25 to tell this story. 

I was working super hard at changing my eating habits, and had recently discovered salad! I especially loved Wendy's salads, and I had just eaten a Cesar salad for dinner, when I decided to go up the street to the middle school track, and walk/run a few laps. 

The middle school recently had all the roads rerouted around it, and as a result, the back doors faced the main road. Right outside the back doors was a massive blacktop leading up to the track. They had 4 square and hop scotch areas, tetherball, and a basketball court. Because of the roads being ripped up and re-done, the new parking lot also faced the back doors, so I was able to drive up and park right in front of/on the basketball court.  

It was dusk and I had just completed my 2nd lap when my stomach started cramping and gurgling. I wasn't too concerned, because I had already learned that the healthier foods digest differently, often causing gas or bubbles in my tummy. I had felt that before and it always subsided without incident. 
Four laps made a mile, so I continued on, going for the mile. I was halfway through my 3rd lap, when things got serious. The ripping feeling across my bowels, and the incredibly loud sounds coming up from my stomach, were both insisting that I get to a toilet, FAST. I wait for the cramping to subside, and make a run for it. I was the furthest away from my car that I could have been. I bolt across the middle grassy area, and before I got halfway there, I had to stop and sit again, just in an effort to keep the poop in. There were NO toilets around. My stomach was RAGING. I wasn't gonna get another ""window"", I was gonna have to pinch my cheeks together and waddle-run to my car. 

I was feet away from my car when I knew: It was either shit my pants or squat where I was. I frantically yanked my pants down, and as I was trying to squat in front of my car (to hide from the main road), my stomach exploded. I shat on myself, my pants around my ankles, my own car hood, the license plate, and the basketball court. I was covered in sweat, shit and shame. I couldn't even understand what just happened. I grabbed some garbage from my back seat, placed it on the driver seat, and drove home. 

I took a scalding shower, got dressed and went outside to clean the poop off my car hood. My son comes out, curious why I'm dumping hot water on the license plate, so I told him. He laughed so hard, that I put him up for adoption (no takers). I realized that I couldn't just leave the poop at the school, so I filled jugs with hot water, grabbed a scrubber and my recently orphaned child, and went to the school to clean up my mess. I left my car lights on so I could make sure I got it all, and when I pulled up, it looked like someone had died there. It was an odd, almost reddish color, and after the 3 gallons of hot water and bleach, it was clear: I left a 3 foot tall, 4 foot wide shit stain on the basketball court. My son was horrified. ""MOM I GO TO SCHOOL HERE!"" Now it was my turn to laugh hysterically, which I did, as my 12 year old son looked traumatized.
I found out the next day, that Cesar salad dressing has anchovy paste in it, which can cause explosive shits in just about anyone. Don't care. I still eat it. 

For the next two years, the stain VERY SLOWLY faded. Everytime my kid went outside for recess, he would see the stain, and die of embarassment (even though we were the only ones who knew). It was super useful- Anytime my kid got mouthy, I'd just threaten to tell his friends about the stain. He rejoiced when it was time for him to move onto the high school. 

3 years after, the whole blacktop was ripped up and replaced, along with the school and track. I stuck with my diet, and lost 140 pounds. The stain is gone, and so is my fupa- but the memory lives on, and the mystery probably does too- because the stain was noticed. By many.

TL;DR- Salad made me shit on my car, myself and all over the basketball court at my Son's middle school.

TIFU by using a heating pad to heat up a glass mason jar filled with milk and hot cocoa.,t2_5skbu8yt,"Since it wouldn’t fit in the microwave, I thought using a heating pad would be a great idea. Turns out, I couldn’t even come closer to being wrong. About 2 minutes in, I heard a snap. I didn’t think much of it, since the jar still LOOKED fine. One tap, though, everything just fell apart. IT WENT ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE. And it took forever to clean. I had to unhook the pad, throw the jar out, try and pry the bottom of it off of the heating pad since the burnt hot chocolate turned into a volcanic slime, and spend 30+ minutes cleaning the milk and hot cocoa mix that was literally everywhere EXCEPT in the jar. The worst part is that this all took place during the night, so I had to be gentle and quiet while dealing with it all to not wake anyone up, which made everything so much harder. Thankfully, there weren’t any glass shards, since it cut cleanly around the bottom, but still. It’s an experience that I’m both embarrassed about, and one that I’m sort of glad to have had, since now I know one big thing of what not to do in this situation. 



TL;DR - If you ever want to heat up milk with hot cocoa mix for some nice hot chocolate, use anything else but glass (maybe a small pot, which I feel dumb for not thinking of that at the time), because you could end up wasting a lot of milk and hot cocoa mix for no other reason other than you were being a dumbass.",14

Soo I was by the sink washing dishes right before we are about to leave for a gig and my friend made fun of the way I was saying marigold (the flower) and I jokingly kicked behind me to get him to stop turns out I smacked him right on the knee and he starts screaming and trying to hold onto something I thought he was joking around with me cause he normally does but he’s still continuing to scream after I laugh at him 

Turns out I DISLOCATED his knee and popped it out of its socket... minutes before we left to play at a gig. 
This happen tonight he’s still currently in so much pain because we had to go straight to the gig and we currently just finished as I’m typing this. I feel awful cause he had to stand this entire time on his leg AHHH

TL;DR : I kicked my friend in the leg cause he was teasing me and I popped the knee cap out and dislocated it",12
TIFU showing my mom a cute pic of my cat,t2_5hxdby9j,"This happened a couple of weeks ago.

My mom and I have kind of a rough relationship, but it's been getting better. So we were having a really nice moment a couple of weeks ago and I was showing her some pictures on my phone. At first I was choosing pics and showing the phone to her but as we were laughing and enjoying our conversation I just kept the phone aimed at her as I scrolled through my camera roll all relaxed like there was nothing that could go wrong 🙄.

So I'm totally relaxed and scrolling nice and slow through my pics when the unthinkable happens. I show my mother a nude. Of me. Not just any nude either, because I'm a freak. And usually that's fun. Unless my mother sees a pic of it. This particular pics had me in a collar and leash with nipple clamps on. The nipple clamps have bells on them.

I felt my face heat up and my whole world stopped. I felt a jolt of panic. I wanted to crawl into a hole.

And like a fucking idiot, when I get to the pic I stop talking and look at it like ??? And then I say ""oh that's me."" Why did I say that??? So she definitely got a good look in at the pic. And she laughs for a very long time while I stand there in the damned kitchen with my pulse beating in my face a long steady internal scream and then she goes ""I used to call my cat Jingle Butt, I think I'll call you Jingle Boobs."" 

TL;DR I got overly comfortable scrolling through my camera roll with my mom and accidentally showed her a naked pic that revealed my nudity and a kink or two and earned me the nickname Jingle Boobs.",49
TIFU drove the car into an electric fence gate.,t2_47icy3rg,"This actually happened yesterday as one of my few driving lessons. I am in my early teenage years, so I am still trying to get a hang of the car. I had taken driving lessons so I was feeling really confident to start doing chores for my parents. My parents drove first to leave my grandmother at her house and then I took the wheel.

I was a bit nervous cause we had to drive through a route I didnt know much about. Driving up the hill, a car is parked really close to my lane and I proceed to hit its rear view mirror. The guy followed us and as we parked we ended up owing him about 20$

We went to do the chore and I was given the car again to take us back home. I was more familiar with this route and so I got us home with no issues. Fast forward a couple of hours, my dad wants me to take the car again to do the last chore of the day, picking up a shirt.

Drove all the way there with no problems, and then we had to go through some security to get to the neighborhood. My dad already seemed like he was in a bad mood, so I was nervous to say the least. They made us wait for a couple more minutes, which just made his mood even worse.

After a good 15 min, they let me through and this is were it all went downhill. I was pretty sure I was hitting the breaks but the car kept moving and my dad screamed at me to stop the car since the electrical fence gate was still opening up. I panicked, confused at why the car wasn't coming to a stop I changed my foot from the break, to the pedal. 

This went as bad as you can imagine, the huge door that was opening infront of us, had yet to be openend completely and so I drove right into it and basically slammed it open. My heart was racing and I was basically in shock. I managed to stop the car but the damage had already been done.

We're still waiting for the total cost of the fence gate, but its safe to say I wont be driving again any time soon. Due to this little accident, I will also be missing my senior trip due to the costs of repairing the fence gate and repairing the damage done to the front of the car. Living in a 3rd world country, the price of those motorized gates will be quite high.


TL/DR: Drove into a electrical fence gate after confusing the breaks and the pedal.",3
TIFU by locking my half-naked self out of my house for three hours,t2_43jcknk5,"I *was* planning on going for a walk. So, I grabbed my phone and my keys, headed for the door, grabbed a trash bag with my free hand, and exited the house. I dropped the trash bag on the trunk of the bag, went back to the door, clicked the little inside latch, and closed the door behind me. Then I tried to turn the keys around in my hand and found that I wasn't carrying them.

To explain how this happened, I must add that the phone has a carrying case with a little ring on it. I can slide my finger into the ring and thus carry the phone without worrying about dropping it.

The ring felt like my keychain.

Oops.

Fine. It's a nice day. I think I'll go for a walk. So, I did. That was the plan anyway. Half an hour into the walk, I realized I had no water. Then it occurred to me that it was a sunny day and perhaps I should put on the t-shirt that I usually carry with me when I'm out for a walk. Oops. No t-shirt... Fine, fine, fine. Oh, and I'm thirsty.

My wife was out of town. I was half an hour from home, on a hot day, with no water. I was an idiot.

I turned around, walked home, and wondered what to do. My wife was already on her way back — she had debated for home before she found out I had locked myself out of the house — and I needed somewhere to sit. I discovered that my garden she was unlocked. Great! It was getting chilly, so I entered the shed and waited. I got bored, so I listened to a podcast.

It occurred to me that one of the many, many boxes in the shed might contain clothes from our recent move. I found plenty of clothes, all of which belonged to my wife. The only items that fitted were a summer dress and a blanket. I chose the blanket.

I kept digging. I found pots, pans, and a horse-cock dildo which I had been meaning to send (as a gag gift) to a recently divorced friend. Yes, my wife knew. Yes, my wife was OK with it. Anyway, it was big, purple, and scary-looking. I did not put it on the back porch. I *did* put the pots and pans on the back porch.

That's when I realized that my neighbors and their friends were watching me go back and forth between the shed and the back porch. I was naked from the waist up, wearing Army gym shorts, and looking slightly grubby.

I checked the time. I realized I had been listening to podcasts in the shed for two hours. As I chatted with them, it became clear that their party had been going on for longer than that. That meant they were being confronted with a half-naked, hairy, slightly grubby-looking man who had suddenly sprung from a shed that they had no reason to believe contained a human being, let alone a half-naked, hairy, slightly grubby one.

Then my wife got home.

tl;dr I locked my half-naked self out of my house for three hours, and then startled my neighbors after dark",18
TIFU by telling a coworker about a short fling I had with a manager from a different department 9 months ago.,t2_95j6ss2g,"I feel so stupid. Should’ve kept this to myself. I hate when I become a blabber mouth and over share. I gave her every detail, every nook and cranny. I left no stone unturned. She knows it all. 
I’ve kept it secret for so long but lately I’ve been struggling with how things ended between me and him. And I guess I finally came to my breaking point of keeping this bottled inside. She took the info as a shocker. And the more she gasped the more I shared. It felt good to let it all out. But once I got home that sense of relief went right out the window. Now I’m beating myself up about how this all could go south. And I don’t think I’m worried about her telling anyone. I’m more worried about how I didn’t hesitate to overshare. I didn’t keep it short and sweet. Instead I spent nearly 2 hours giving her details blow by blow. From the size of his package to his home decor. I just want to take this as a lesson to never over share like this ever again no matter how long somethings been bothering me. At least not to another coworker. 




TL; DR: Overshared details with a coworker about a fling I had with another coworker who is a manger. Feeling stupid for not keeping it short and sweet but instead giving her all the details. So I’m currently beating myself up for being a blabber mouth.",4
TIFU By taking off my shoes on a plane,t2_d31al,"Obligatory this didn't happen today.

Hark back to 2010. A fabulous year of living in a Charity's beach commune in rural Greece. The charity was helping protect/ rescue/ tag loggerhead turtles and their nests. For the five months I was there, shoes were rarely worn. We were staying in an olive grove and worked on a beach.

At the end of the project I had become accustomed to not wearing any footwear at all and when I made my way back to Athens I had to wear something on my feet again. I chose my thongs (flip-flops/ jangles/ sandels/ whatever you call them in your country).

As I made my way to the airport after trekking around Athens for a couple of weeks, while working in the charity rescue centre and doing a lot of sightseeing, the footwear broke. I didn't want to buy another set on the day I was flying out so decided to throw on the old runners (trainers/ sneakers/ tennis shoes/ whatever you call them in your country).

The shoes were really uncomfortable. They were cheap and I hadn't worn them in half a year. They had become dried out to the point of feeling sharp, rigid and uncomfortably stiff, and the material inside wasn't soft at all anymore. The lining on the heel cup had degraded and broken plastic was visible through the crumbling yellow foam.

I got to the airport, checked in, got through security, got to the gate and waited to board the plane. My feet were killing me. I could swear I had given myself open sores or blisters from the material rubbing on my heals because me being dumb, decided socks were for pussies and turns out I am a pussy because my feet were in a lot of pain.

When we got on the plane I was exhausted from partying in the hostel all week. I kicked off my shoes, using my feet to slide them under my seat, laid back with my eyes closed and had a gentle snooze. Finally I could relax.

Then I'm woken up by the staff rather franticly walking up and down the aisle. The plane was still on the tarmac and we were 10 minutes behind schedule. By this time we should have been in the air.

Not long afterwards they start to check the overhead bins. I ask someone what's happening as I couldn't understand the Greek. They reply that there's a weird smell and they believe there might be some sort of device on the plane.

""Device? Smell? The only smell I can get is... Oh no, my shoes!"" I thought to myself. 

I reached under my chair and grab my shoes. ""Quick, get them back on. I don't usually have smelly feet, ever! My feet never smell at all so why are they so bad now?"" I said to myself as I tried to be stealthy putting my stinky shoes back on.

These old shoes had started to stink as badly as any old rancid boot I'd smelt before. It must have been that they were cheap, old, and I didn't wear socks so my feet have been sweating in the seering Greek heat all day. I go to pull them on but my heals are weeping. I had cut them and now putting the shoes back on was agony. I couldn't go on like this.

I decided that I could engineer a fix by going to the toilet, washing my feet and using the hand towels (as they are stronger than toilet tissue) to line the heal of my shoe enough that would be comfortable so I could keep them on for the rest of the flight.

I made my way to the toilet with the shoes in my arms, pressed against my chest to conceal the smell. I get to the toilet door and thank goodness it's not occupied. Immediately an air stewardess approaches and puts her arm infront of the door and blocks me from going in.

""Sir, please take your seat.""

""I really need to go to the toilet.""

""Sir, we are still on the tarmac and we are performing a search on the plane. Please take your seat.""

I decided to lie in order to try and get permission to use the toilet despite them searching the plane. I thought if I pretended it was urgent she would make an exception and let me go.

""I..I have diarrhea, I really need to go now.""

""Sir, please go back to your seat. Try your best to hold it and we will be in the air soon and when the Captain switches off the seatbelt sign you can go.""

""I can't hold it, I need to go now.""

""Sir I won't ask you again...""

At this point two male air stewards approach.

""What's the problem here?"" One asks the stewardess.

""This gentleman is refusing to go back to his seat. He says he has diarrhea.""

""Sir, you have been asked to take your seat. If you don't follow staff instructions we will remove you from the plane.""

At this point I'm done. This isn't worth it. I'm going to go back to my seat and pull on the shoes and sort out the bleeding when the plane takes off. No worries, I can bare it for another 10 minutes or something.

""Ok, I'm sorry. I'll go back to my seat. I'm sorry to cause a problem.""

""Wait! What are you holding?""

""Oh, these are just my shoes.""

""Why aren't they on your feet?""

""My heals are bleeding so I took them off.""

""Why are you taking them to the toilet?""

""To pad the back where they are broken so I can put them on again and they won't make my feet bleed.""

""Pad them with what?""

""Wet hand towels.""

""That won't work. We can get you some bandages (plasters/ band aids/ whatever you call them in your country) from the first aid kit. Please put your shoes back on for now and we will bring them to your seat.""

As soon as I put the shoes down on the floor the air around us is rank with the smell they had thought was a device; they realised it was actually my smelly shoes and started laughing at me.

One of the air stewards followed me back to my seat with a couple of bandages and some wet wipes. He then announced to the plane that the (so far) 25 minute delay to take off had been caused by my stinky feet. I could feel the hate from all around as anyone who could see me stared daggers at me.

I cleaned my cuts, applied the bandages and put my shoes back on, all the while feeling very embarrassed, so stayed low in my chair as the Greeks talked about how much of an asshole I was.

A Greek woman next to me comforted her elderly mother who was crying because she thought that we might not take off in enough time to make their connecting flight. They both stared at me as though I was the devil.

Just when I thought the embarrassment couldn't get any worse, shortly after take off the female flight attendant came up to me and very loudly said
""I know that you have diarrhea so would you like to go to the toilet now?""

Tl;Dr: I took off my shoes on a plane and the smell caused an emergency false alarm which delayed takeoff while I pretended I had diarrhea and incurred the scorn of a plane full of angry Greek people.",47
Tifu: I c**ped into my pants inside a crowded elevator,t2_99r1r2vs,"I go to a school that’s located on top of a hill, we have one and a half hour break for lunch. There is a mall at the bottom of the hill. On the fateful day I had a massive craving for KFC, so I split from my friends and headed down the mall. 

Midway down, I felt this bubbling in my stomach, it came on quick like a violent current. Realising my time was limited, I visualised my route to the nearest toilet which is located at the food hall of the mall.

Breaking into a brief run, with utmost focus, I akwardly kept my body upright and tight for full control of my sphincter, eventually I  managed to lump myself along to the elevator located on the park entrance of the mall. 

This was during peak lunch hour so there was a crowd in front of a row of three elevators. I budge myself into the first opening door to the annoyance of some of the people I bumped off. I apologise profusely whilst trying to hold in a likely wet fart.

I positioned myself in the corner of the carriage, my body still in motion only makes the need to shit more pronounced. It is then I noticed the door kept opening and closing, some prick is trying to fit in. At this point despair and anxiety manifested as big beads of sweat drenching me, which further added to the urgency of the situation. “Get the fuck out” I blurted. I was too self absorbed to care about etiquette. The door finally closed. 

As the elevator moved from 4/f to G/f my sphincter has reached its limit. The raging torrent of fecal matter was going to breakthrough the gates no matter how hard I tried to hold it in. The first gush came out as a small squeak. Barely audible but Super pungent to the nostrils. The two girls next to me covered their nose in tandem, and I felt people behind me shuffling in panic. I closed my eyes denying myself of this reality also focusing desperately in contemplation of damage control options. 

My sixth sense tells me that all eyes are now on me.  They must have found out that I was the source of smell. It is at this time I relinquished control, my will too exhausted, I resigned myself to the cruel hands of fate. What followed was the most liberating and embarrassing moment of my life so far. With a sound reminiscent of an unhinged wooden door creaking under the breeze in a wet and rainy day, I emptied my bowels into my pants. In no time the ungodly smell filled the elevator in my moment of Auschwitz. The door finally opened and people scurried away in disgust, I opened my eyes and continued my walk of shame to the toilet. 

I spent hours in the toilet, waited for the lunching crowd to disperse so that I can do my best to clean up which was itself a Sisyphean task. I used my lunch money to catch a cab home. Luckily the cabbie showed me empathy and laughed at my retelling of the story, with all the windows down and the chuckling of the cabbie, I went home worried about what to tell my parents on why I skipped school.


Tl:dr Crapping myself inside a very crowded elevator during the lunch hour.",16
TIFU by not know what hats were,t2_3aml6dj7,"Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but two years ago. 

I was applying for a job, and during the interview, I was asked if I could wear many different hats.

Apparently this is a metaphor for being able to do many different tasks and adapting to new problems, but I had never heard this before and had no clue what it meant.

I thought the interviewer was getting more comfortable with me and was joking around asking if I could wear many hats because of some crazy hat day they must have at work and that the question was a joke to break the ice.

So I laughed and was like “oh yeah I can wear hats.” 

The interviewer looked confused and didn’t match my joking mood so I realized something was wrong. They then probably saw that I then look frightened and confused and asked if I was flexible and good at adapting to changes. I answered yes and continued the interview.

TL;DR: I was asked if I could wear many hats and thought the question was literal.

Edit: Thank you for all the responses! But I need to go to sleep",11
TIFU by not realizing how much a phone microphone picks up,t2_53l1ziwg,"This has happened over a long period of time but I only learned about it recently.

I always go outside to take phone calls while I’m at work. I don’t want anyone to interrupt me and I don’t want my talking to bother anyone else. Well, when you’re around people there are some things that aren’t considered appropriate in a professional setting. So when I go outside to take a phone call, I always let off the gas that’s been building up while I’ve been at my desk.

My lady friend called, I went outside, ripped one, and it smelled bad so I said, “man, that was a judgement error.” I expected her to ask what I meant because she had no idea what I was talking about. I was wrong: she said, “why, does it stink?” I asked if she heard it, and she confirmed that yes, she did, it sounded like a rusty door hinge.

As for the FU: I’ve taken or made calls with whole array of people:  insurance, banks, tech support, customer service, friends, co-workers... and now I’m sure they’ve all had to listen to my flatulence and were too polite or professional or embarrassed to say anything about it.

tldr; I have a habit of farting while I’m outside on the phone and I only recently learned the microphone can hear it clear as a bell.",102
TIFU by doing my job well,t2_16wa7r,"I've been a long time lurker here but I think I finally messed up and have to share it with someone. So. It happened this week when I had a meeting with my boss.

Background info here: I'm an introvert, like, for REAL. I'm really uncomfortable keeping in touch with friends and family, I tend to isolate frequently and I'm an overall mess when it comes to communication. I don't lack any social skills, but most of the time I just prefer not to interact.
Also, I'm a teacher, and my company/school is super open minded and modern when it comes to teaching; we're there to teach but also to create bonds with the students.

Of course, I've been overcompensating my lack of communication-energy while I work there. I know I have problems with it so I try extra hard to do my job the best way I can.

And I actually do it really well! And that's the problem!

I've recently had a meeting with my boss and found out they're opening a new branch/section to improve the internal processes through...better communication, teamwork and more personal relationships.
And I'll be fully involved in it.
Because as they say ""My strongest trait is how well I communicate/relate/bond with people"" (I even got a Christmas card reinforcing that today!).

It's quite the opposite. I'm screwed.
Fake it till you make it, I guess?

TL;DR: I can't communicate with people for shit but now I'm charge of that (communication) in my company because I've been overcompensating my lack of skills.",43
TIFU by accidentally watching the first 10(ish) minutes of Star Wars Episode IX before I watched Episode VIII (Spoilers Alert),t2_92omvdv6," 

So  I have been vaguely aware of this subreddit for a while now but I  generally don’t come here and I have never had reason to post here until  now. Normally I find the stories here either laughably fake or humble  brag type material so I avoid. Anyway here goes

So  a little backstory to this is that I have only seen up to Star wars  Episode VII thus far. The reason behind this is that I was in prison for  the past 3 years from late 2017 until this past Fall. I never had the  chance to see either of the next two movies before or during my  incarceration and therefore decided to take the opportunity now. I am  off work for a couple days and I just finished up Avengers:Endgame and   Spider Man:Far From Home. Until now I have been able to avoid any  spoilers which is no small fear in a prison environment where everyone  talks.I was able to see a portion of the middle of Star Wars while  locked up but it was not much just enough to see that Snoke was  involved. It should be noted that I did not remember the name of the  movie when I went to watch it earlier (just a few minutes ago in fact)  and this contributed to my mistake.

At  any rate I decide the next movies on my catch up list are the 2 newest  Star Wars films. Well I should have done more research because I did not  look at the dates of the films and judged the chronology based on the  titles (rookie mistake). So I figured The “LAST” Jedi would be the LAST  movie but that was obviously a huge error because I started Rise of  Skywalker instead. Now I know I should have noticed the episode number  at the very least but it is late and I was eager to start the movie so I  ignored most of the title on the file. Well I start the movie and  immediately the famous scroll starts explaining the story so far. I did  not recall any of the story it was referring to but I thought maybe I  forgot seeing as it was 3 years ago I saw episode VI.

Big  mistake continuing to watch! I see Kylo Ren mowing down a group of foes  and snatching a green object from a pedestal. Okay... I keep watching  an he is talking to someone now and that someone is... Palpatine wait  wtf?!? Now Ren says that he killed Snoke?!? Pause Movie—&gt;exit and  check files... Damn! I watched the first part of the wrong movie and  just spoiled a major plot detail!!

So  now I am going to watch The Last Jedi and try to forget what I heard  but knowing that I can’t. Well that it what I get for being careless.  Thanks to yall for reading this dumb story but I thought this would be  perfect for here.

TL;DR  I have  not seen the newest 2 Star Wars movies due to circumstances and I  started watching the 9th installment in the franchise before the 8th due  to a careless mistake. This resulted in an (so far) undetermined  magnitude of spoilers being revealed.",7
TIFU: By saying “jacking off” numerous times to a female co-worker in a very professional work space,t2_dhkzk5h,"I’ve (33M) been a middle school basketball coach for a number of years. Well, today while trying to have a friendly conversation with a co-worker (67F) about the boys on my team and how they do not listen all that well, I repeatedly said that all they do is jack off. Each time I said it she looked borderline disgusted but the words just kept spewing out of my mouth. 

The conversation ends rather awkwardly, and a couple minutes later I’m hit with the feeling of horror as my brain replays the conversation. I had just put the imagine of a bunch of masturbating middle school boys into the mind of my co-worker not once, but 3-4 times. All along I meant to be saying “jack around” but my brain failed me.  

Solid start to 2021.

TIFU by staying up at night,t2_3mwlkpzh,"Uhhh so I’m on mobile sorry
So I was playing roblox with my friend around 12am and said I was going to bed but really I stayed up and looked at memes for all of night.

I was just in bed shifting trying to get comfy laughing in my head at the sub and heard noises from upstairs.

First
my room is in the basement and i share a room with my sister (but good thing she was sleeping in the living room down stairs)

And you see my moms room is above mine (maybe you see where this is going) 
Idk how long she met her friend (is prob bf tbh)
But looking at memes I stop because I heard a sound 
Uhhhhh it was weird but I think I heard my mom doing ya know 

And my immediate reaction was to grab my headphones but they are Bluetooth
I started my headphones and they beeped as usual but it scared me because I thought someone could hear 
But I stated to play music 
And trying to sleep but now I’m very weirded out
OMG  i hecking heard the heckin bed shake my music was not loud enough so I turn it up but trying to make it not to loud so no one heard 

I don’t know if they stopped but I still hear a little creek here and there

Now I can’t go to bed, now it’s 4:44am (they started around like 3am or something)

TIFU by burning my eardrum,t2_tfmag,"Well this happened just a bit ago. My ears felt a little waxy so I decided to go get an ear cleaning kit from the pharmacy to flush them out. So I opened the kit and read the instructions and proceeded to follow them.

I started adding the drops of the solution into my ear, it said to do 10 drops. As I was doing it I thought “huh this burn a little more than I thought” and “wow it’s really bubbly.” I then put the ear plug in like it said.

Suddenly, my ear felt like it was on fire, intense bubbling inside, a lot of pressure and pain. So I started reading the box to see if it said anything about it and then I saw it in tiny tiny text “avoid using if you have tubes in ear” and then it hit me.

I had forgotten that I had a tube put in my ear a year or so ago (I had them as a kid too) and I didn’t think to check into it. So now I’m laying down with a bottom ball in my ear trying to drain any solution out. I can still hear by the way, so all good there at least.

Read the box in its entirety, kids.

TL;DR: forgot I had a tube in my ear, used an ear cleaning solution to remove earwax and ended up feeling like my eardrum was on fire",18
TIFU by showing all my friends my naked wife,t2_5ermlzh4,"Here's a fuck up I had exactly 24 hours ago. I didn't really think about sharing this one, but since I got a notification, that my throw away account has a cake day, I just couldn't miss the opportunity that I had so similar TIFU exactly a year ago!!

So during these COVID times, my friends and I just chat in the Discord pretty often. Yesterday was one of those days, and since I had just finished my first exam, it was time to celebrate. That meant that I brought my Vodka from the freezer and we started doing proper shots. Now, whenever I drink during discord calls, I get really loud. Not really sure why, but it just makes the call 10 times better if I can laugh with my full voice. My wife on the other hand is the best wife a man can ever have! When ever we have that kind of night with my friends, she's okay with falling asleep on the couch (since my pc is in the bedroom).

So there we are having our drinks and just chatting. I suddenly have a very good idea about turning our cameras on, since it would make drinking so much more fun! After a bit of time everybody agree and that's what we do. We had like 11 people in the call, with everybody's cameras on! It was so fun! After a while at one moment I took a toilet break, and then while sneaking through our living room, my wife suddenly said: ""No need to sneak, I'm not sleeping."" Its 4AM. She is really angry. I go right to her and start asking why she didn't tell me. Usually she falls asleep really quick, but this time it was much harder for her. She said that I was being too loud. I was very sorry and offered her that she can come to bed and I'll just call it a night with my friends. She said angrily, that she didn't care and that she will stay on the couch. Since my bladder was about to explode, I just ran to the toilet.

When I came back, I didn't see her on the couch anymore. She had gone to bed. I ran to our bedroom just to see that I had been disconnected from the Discord call. That meant that everybody saw her. I explained her the situation and called everybody back right away to ask how many of them had seen. The admin of our Discord server said that they reacted quickly and everybody didn't see. I disconnected and ran back to the bed to comfort my wife. But then she explained to me that it would've been one thing if she walked straight to the bed, but instead she walked right towards and then past the computer to turn off the light on my table. Everybody got an absolutely clear view. She didn't even think about that I have video on, since we do it so rarely with a webcam enabled.

So there I was... Crushed with shame and a proper hangover.
Today I took myself together and went back to their discord, they didn't mention the situation and everything seems to be going good. Its just the idea that ALL OF MY FRIENDS SAW MY WIFE NAKED, is what makes me feel soooo baaaaaad! So bad for my wife... She didn't even now...

And now the fact that it has exactly been a year from the last situation with Discord makes it even funnier. I hope you guys get a good laugh out of it.

TL;DR: I left my Discord call open with a working webcam, while I went to the toilet and my wife walked past it, completely naked, and all of my friends saw her.",23
TIFU by attempting to shovel driveways.,t2_2lphu91a,"It's winter. I live in a cold country, we get a lot of snow. I thought I would be the good guy and shovel drives and salt them for the neighbors. On my second drive however, a thought occurred. I'd drank coffee that morning, and was drinking one from a flask. Coffee is a very strong laxative for me.

I was stood, in my neighbors drive as the feeling hit, it wasn't stopping, time to mkve. I began to run, not thinking about the ice, and ended up slipping in their drive. The shock from falling made me lose focus, and I let loose. It ended up coming up and out of my pants from the impact of hitting the ground, leaving a mess in the drive.

I waddled home and showered, before cleaning their drive and giving up. 

I have since received kind words from various neighbours, which is ridiculously embarrassing as I think they seen it happen. At least they'll know to clear their own drives now. 

TL;DR I was doing a good deed and hilariously soiled myself in my neighbors drive.",15
TIFU by giving my toddler a metal cup,t2_hym69,"I bought the cup last week but today my poor decision came home to roost. My son is 18 months old and not overly fond of bed time. He's also got this rotten little habit of stashing his sippy cups in weird places where they end up getting smooshed. 
I was out shopping at a store with a lot of camping stuff and stumbled on a sippy cup made of metal. It's yeti-style with a plastic screw on lid. Jackpot! If this thing gets stuck under the recliner, it's not going to explode when someone sits down. 

Cue today, half hour ago. It's late and the little guy just does not want to go to sleep. We rocked him, we snuggled him, we ended up giving him the sippy cup. A few minutes into a cozy cuddle and all of a sudden...

BAM!

He swung his cup and smacked me dead center of the bridge of my nose. Then the little poop machine starts crying because when I yelled ow, it scared the hell out of him. My nose isn't broken but it's definitely going to be swollen and it hurts like hell. 

Tl;dr - gave my boy a metal cup, he busted my nose with it.",20
TIFU by reading my dad's message to my mom,t2_42r8611m,"I was on my mom's phone earlier today so I could send a message to my grandmother and then a text pops up from dad that said ""I'll be out as soon as I'm done beating it to your pictures "".   needless to say I'm scarred for life . I'm glad I didn't click on the text because I'm pretty sure there was a image attached ... this doesn't compare to the time I walked in on them when I was a child . Never going on my mother's phone again ..... I don't have anything else to say lmao but I have to meet the minimum text so ignore this I guess 

Edit 1 :guys I'm not mad that my parents have a
 healthy sex life/ relationship I'm  glad .. but it's still weird to know about it . If you have kids I'm sure you wouldn't want them knowing about your sex life lmaoo. Anyways I'm glad my parents love each other

Edit 2: I was on my mom's phone texting my grandma about a recipe I needed because I had my phone taken away . I made the post as soon as I got it back lmao  

TL;DR: found out my dad beats it to my mom's pics",795
TIFU Almost became a statistic of people drowned in the Kern River,t2_19l53a,"I went camping and river tubing to along the Kern River. The water was at most waste high in most places on the river. There are some rapids and small waterfalls along the way. I was river tubing and the river was leading to a waterfall that didn't look too bad, when suddenly the current took me in another direction towards some large boulders. Instead of going over the boulders, the water was being sucked down a crevice under the boulders.

The current pushed me in between the boulders and I got flipped off my inner tube. I was sandwiched between the boulders and my inner tube by the water. The current was so strong that it popped my inner tube and sucked it away into the boulders. Now, I was pinned against the boulders by the current of the river. I could barely move. The water was up to my neck and couldn't climb out. 

I was scared. I didn't know how long I could stand being pounded by the river with water rushing against my face. I made the decision to dive down and hopefully go through the same hole that took my inner tube. I dove down and felt my way to an opening. The current of the river shot me through the hole and out the other side. Good thing I decided to wear a life vest. After I made it out of the hole, the life vest pulled me back up to the surface of the river.

Thinking back on this incident, I'm not sure if I made the best decision. What if the opening at the bottom was too small for me to fit through? What if there was another boulder blocking the exit? The river current would have been too strong for me to get back out. I would have ended up as a +1 on the local sign in town that said. ""Kern River: 294 Lives lost since 1968.""

TLDR: I almost drowned tubing down the Kern River. Wear a life vest.",16
TIFU by dropping a pair of used panties in front of a lady at the grocery store,t2_5j3f56f9,"I have a puppy and she likes to get into things she shouldn’t of course, but for whatever reason if I am distracted for even just a minute she likes to run up to my room and dig through my used clothing hamper. Well, I was in a rush to get out the door while my parents offered to watch her while I was gone and that’s when I caught her chewing on a used thong she stole out of my hamper. My parents were in another room and I felt embarrassed and didn’t want them to see it, so I just quickly shoved the thong in my jacket pocket and let them know I had to leave and thanked them for watching her while I ran out the door to do my errands. I head to the store, grab all my groceries and check out, then decide to start my car a little bit ahead of time so it’s warm when I get there. I go to grab my keys out of my pocket and start fumbling around a little bit while completely forgetting what else is in my pocket. Then suddenly BAM...... my used ass panties are on the grocery store floor before I know it.. I don’t think anyone else saw what it was besides one lady who for sure did and just gave me a really weird look and then just walked away .... but yeah... picked them up as quick as possible and tried to play it cool. I am mortified and hopefully she doesn’t think I’m a sick pervert or something.

TL;DR My dog stole a pair of my used panties, so I shoved them in my pocket so my parents wouldn’t see..forget about them. Ended up dropping them in the grocery store and a lady saw and now I am embarrassed.",19
TIFU by accidentally revealing too much about my sex life to my coworkers,t2_3fgw6b6f,"So I’m currently sitting in the bathroom and seriously considering quitting my job. I’m a nurse at a clinic and we just recently hired a new clinical lead. She wanted to hold a quick staff meeting with all of us to introduce herself, get to know us, etc. As per usual, we start off with an ice breaker where you introduce yourself and state a hidden talent.

Obviously this made me panic because I have no  real talents. I’m wracking my brain for something while everyone else goes and before I know it’s my turn and I have nothing to say. Everyone’s staring at me so I just nervous ramble and end up saying something along the lines of:
“Hi I’m u/kris6563 and I don’t really have any hidden talents. I mean I can put my whole fist in my mouth but I don’t think that counts.. uh I can put both my feet behind my head... that’s not really a good talent either but at least my last boyfriend thought it was cool... because.. uh.. he really liked gymnastics” 

The response was the expected silence with an awkward chuckle from some coworkers who really felt the second hand embarrassment. But basically now I’m too terrified to even show face in office and think I’m just going to call in sick for the rest of the day. 

TLDR: I don’t know when to quit talking and revealed that my ex appreciated the fact I could put my fist in my mouth and my feet behind my head at a staff meeting.",68
TIFU by drinking a venti cold brew at Starbucks,t2_7apjbt1u,"This technically happened yesterday, as it is 1:47am while I’m posting this(I live in India).

I went for a ride on my bicycle, and decided to treat myself with a muffin and a coffee in Starbucks, as a new one just opened up at the endpoint of my route. It is important to remember I’ve only had coffee twice since the lockdown, while I’d consume it pretty much every other day before March. I ordered a venti as that used to be my standard order, without realising I haven’t had caffeine in such quantities in a long time. So now I’m wide awake even though I had only 6 hours of sleep the previous night, and coffee having laxative effects on some, has really opened up my asshole. 

It gets even more interesting because I have to join a 75 mile bicycle ride in the morning at 5am, for which I need to wake up at 4am.

TLDR; drank a whole lot of coffee after a long time, and can’t sleep now

Edit : after completing 100kms(roughly 63 miles) I’m back to the same Starbucks, drinking that same Venti Cold Brew again just to make it through the day as I’ve got a couple of meetings lined up.",58
TIFU by poisoning my own cup of tea,t2_94hjjv4s,"First ever post on reddit, previously a serial scroller but I’m wired with nothing else to do so here we go.

For context I’m caffeine intolerant, so if I have caffeine I get all the usual effects but 1000 times stronger...

Tonight before bed I made one of those sleepy, knock you out for good, herbal teas. My housemate had actually been gifted a box of very fancy french tea bags. I picked one called ‘1001 Nuits’, the last time I spoke french was in high school on my french speaking exam. Even then I’d hidden a cheat sheet in my calculator but I still trusted my language intuition enough to be sure this meant ‘1001 Nights’, it actually smelt like rose and jasmine too which are usual suspects. So now I’m very excited to pass out with the power of 1001 nights worth of sleep so I brewed up and went to bed.

Now.. it’s 8 hours later I have the most intense headache, whilst being more awake than Flash Gordon on speed, plus the knowing dread that I have to deal with two blocked toilets in the morning. If tomorrow I mention being tired and some parent echoes in the distance ‘tired? You don’t know the meaning of tired till you’ve had kids’, I will take these bags from under my eyes and floor them.

But how could this have happened when I had the power of 1001 nights gently lulling me to sleep? Well after a quick, yet delayed, Google search it turns out Nuit is actually a region in France specialising in red wine, and stronger than Mike Tyson black tea. Can’t help but feel this is directly related to me not listening in French class, désolée Madame Robins.

TL;DR - drank black tea despite being intolerant as presumed I understood the French label now very wired/ sick and in need of a plumber",28
TIFU by rushing my Master Plan,t2_3r17prsd,"It’s all over. I’m ruined. This is the end.

I am warning you now: this is a tale of misfortune and woe- namely, mine. A cruel twist of fate that not even I could anticipate. This is the tale of my tragic downfall, and here are the characters.

**My parents:** Firm believers that Video Games can ruin a kid’s life. They are, of course, correct. The total ban on anything video game related is however still uncalled for.

**Me:** Sixteen year old criminal mastermind, IQ in the thousands. Very unlucky. Enjoys video games.

Clearly, these two parties are destined to clash from time to time. My dear parents are aware that I haven’t been too... obedient, but luckily, they are fairly lenient as long as I keep my grades up.

Me? I haven’t been obedient at all. The dumb shit I’ve had to pull off to feed my urge to game deserves a reddit post all on its own. I’ve rarely been *caught* gaming, but I am a terrible liar, and my parents know me pretty well. So our silent battle goes on- me finding ways onto the internet, and my parents catching on and stopping me. And thus begins my FU.

After some inspection of the family calendar, I realised that during the last two weeks of the Christmas holidays, I would be left alone at home for extended periods at a time, completely unsupervised. 

Perfect.

The problem is, my parents have a pretty foolproof way of making sure I don’t abuse their absence: lock every device capable of connecting to the internet in one room, and bring the key with them. I have of course been able to circumnavigate this problem in the past. I was determined to do so again. My determination, sadly, would be my weakness.

There are three possible places that the goods could be locked in: my parent’s room, my brother’s room, and my own bedroom. 

1. Getting in through the windows is out of the question- my parent’s windows are visible from the street and I don’t want to get arrested. My own bedroom needs a ladder to access, which I don’t have. My brother’s room, I *have* snuck into on occasion, but it’s annoying and time consuming since we have flyscreens and access requires two stools and me stealthily unlocking the window between my parents locking it and them collecting all the devices to lock inside the actual room. Also it makes me feel bad. Not a viable option.
2. Hiding in the room while they lock it no longer works. They’ve learnt to check that I’m not inside first. THEY’RE EVOLVING.
3. Hence, the only in way is through the door- the locked, non-openable doors.

But how would you get into the rooms? I’m glad you asked. 

There are three keys for each room, all of them on the same keyring. One of the keys will be labelled with which room they are for (keep note of this- it will, for lack of a better word, be key to the success of my plan). All the sets of keys are placed inside the same drawer, but my parents will of course bring the relevant keys with them as they leave.

Now, it’s only logical that one would inspect the labelled key to know which room it belongs to. Following this logic, that key would be the one which remains in the user’s hand and thus the one that is eventually used to lock/unlock the door. Thus, if any of the other keys are replaced, it probably wouldn’t be noticed. You can see where this is going.

Over the first four weeks of the holidays, I rushed to get all my work done so I could game without guilt. I also made a small container out of cotton balls and a plastic bag so I could handle the keys without them making noise. Within two weeks, I had switched one of the keys of each of the three rooms with one that opened the study: the one room that would never be locked, since I’m always there. Now, no matter what room the devices were locked in, I would have the keys I need to get them- hidden right under my parent’s noses. Genius. For a few days, it actually worked. My trickery remained undetected and my glee was almost uncontainable. 

Now, remember how I said I was a bit too determined? Remember how I’d finished all this in a fortnight? This left a big problem: there were two weeks left for things to go wrong. And go wrong they did.

Today, my parents had business to attend to, *separately*, and they would be home at different times. They of course needed access to their own room, so they SPLIT THE THREE KEYS TO THEIR ROOM. And by further bad luck, the labelled key went one way and the other two- one of which is an impostor- the other. Stupidly, I hadn’t realised that they would do this, even though I should have been able to see it coming. Of course, it didn’t take long for the swapped key to be used, and even less time for my parents to realise that all the sets had been similarly tampered with. Luckily, I’d been pretty productive lately (to get all my work done early, remember?) so they laughed it off instead of giving me a lecture. But they’re going to start taking the devices *with* them as they leave the house now.

That leaves me with two weeks without any work, any source of entertainment, and most importantly, no Youtube, no Reddit, and no League of Legends. All because I was a bit too fast and a bit too intelligent for my own good.

You guys have any ideas?

Tl;dr I used all 23 of my brain cells too quickly, leaving plenty of time for my treachery to be discovered. Sure enough, I was caught with my pants down, and now my plan is ruined.",14
TIFU by getting seethrough underwear online,t2_7ecr6fj3,"I’m 17F and I live with my mom, dad, and sister. My mom is kind of strict with clothes sometimes, especially with undergarments. 

I got a $100 Visa gift card for Christmas and I decided to go to an online clothing store I like and pick out some stuff. She was curious of what I got so I showed her my cart, not everything all close up. 

I got two shirts, shorts, a dress, and a three pack of matching underwear and bra sets. They were normal colors and kind of lacy, so I was nervous about it. But they weren’t seethrough or super scandalous... so I thought lol.

I got the package today and I tried everything on in my room to make sure it all fit. I unpacked the underwear and they were completely seethrough, except the crotch area where you’d put a pad. But even that was tiny, it was the size of a post it. So they’re kind of ~scandalous~ but the bras are lined, so they’re not seethrough. 

Anyway, my mom came in and asked to see everything, and asked if everything fit. 

She got weird about the underwear. She didn’t take it or anything, which I thought she would. But she did scold me a bit and told me she’d have to shop with me from now on. 

I guess not a total fuck up, but it was kind of embarrassing to show my underwear in front of my family.

TL;DR I bought clothes online. I got a three sets of matching bras/underwear, which I didn’t know were completely seethrough lace. My mom yelled at me and embarrassed me by showing my dad and sister my seethrough underwear.

EDIT: so a few people have said my mom’s overstepping boundaries and shouldn’t be controlling my underwear choices. tbh i didn’t know this wasn’t like a normal thing, that people’s parents knew mostly everything they wore?? thanks for commenting on it though &lt;3",16
TIFU by being the crazy neighbor,t2_90da9kfp,"For backstory, we've had a lot of thefts in my area lately. People are constantly posting to different neighborhood apps with clips of people going thru their cars and stealing from their yards.

Starting around 3am, my outside cameras were triggering and sending me alerts. I'd half wake up, see people on the video of the shared driveway, and assume it was the neighbors or their friends partying (I could see that the people walking by were on that side of the driveway). I didn't see anyone carrying away my shit so, yeah, I wasn't getting up.

At about 5:30am, I get an alert from my backyard. Then one from my front door. I see one person standing there with their hand out gesturing to someone off camera. The second person walks over from the direction of my backyard and my dad's car. They walk away and are looking at something in their hands. Maybe. Idk it's 5am and I've been getting woken up all night. I go to my front window and I see them walking by and they start moving faster when they see me.

My half asleep brain said ""go fuck em up, scare those junkies so they don't come back"". I go outside and yell ""hey!"". They start walking faster. I'm following them down the street, barefoot (cause my barely functioning brain also decided we don't need shoes), and trying to get my camera recording on my phone. They turn into a neighbor's driveway, one of the few that has a fence low enough to hop over to get to the next street over. Just as I got there, I heard a door close. Oh no. I think I just chased some neighbors from down the block lol.

Needless to say, I'm sitting here feeling pretty stupid and thinking I'm the new crazy lady on the street, which is really saying something considering the current crazy lady is completely batshit. Awesome.

And... I kept trying to go back to sleep after that but first my cat threw up on everything. Cleaned up, back to bed. My heater started making loud, crazy noises. Check that out, back to bed. My dog decides she needs attention and starts barking at me. Pet her, back to bed. No sleep tho. I'm hoping that's my karma instead of becoming an internet Karen video.

TL;DR - thought some people were stealing my shit super early this morning, chased them, turned out to be my drunk neighbors leaving my next-door drunk neighbor's house. I think. Oops.",2
TIFU by doing way too much edibles,t2_3r97d4n1,"This was last night by I didn't have the mental capacity to type it so I'm doing now.

I normally don't do edibles very often but I recently decided to try them again. In the past when I would do edibles it was from a dealer not the dispensaries so the potency would almost never be correct. They would be advertised as 150mg but after experimentation would discover they were a lot lower. Felt like 30-50mg. So I assumed that these edibles would be likewise. That was my first mistake.

Not only that but these were kin slips. They go under your tongue and dissolve, taking effect in 10 minutes. Now that lead me to believe (for reasons I don't know) that it was a similar high to smoking, jumping up fast and leaving quickly. I was very wrong. Second mistake.

Also, I'm quite thin and have a low body fat percentage. Like 5-10%. Meaning I get high very easily. Not to mention I don't get high very often so my tolerance is almost always rock bottom. I started by taking one 10mg slip. After 10mins I felt a tiny bit high. After 20 mins almost nothing changed. So I took another. 20 mins past and again barely feeling anything and thought the dispensary ripped me off. Took another. And then another. And then one more.

I was going to take ANOTHER ONE but then I realized I was high out of my mind. It was roughly 45 mins after I had taken the first one at this point. My high continued to climb for another 3 hours. At my peak I couldn't form sentences properly, was stumbling all over the place and was even starting to hallucinate as objects started to zoom into my face. I took them intermittently between 7:30 and 9pm. At around 12am I was so fucking high i was starting to hear voices and my environment was moving around me. I went to bed at 2:30am, and was still absolutely baked. Woke up at 7:30am and was STILL high. Went back asleep until 11 and WAS STILL HIGH. The high didnt go away until 1pm the next day. 

TL;DR: Thought my edibles were a dud due to bad assumptions and got way too high.

Edit: counted my opened packs and I apparently only had 40",19
TIFU trying to download a movie from a torrent site.,t2_11zk8w,"I downloaded ""Detective Pikachu"" from a random torrent site and I didn't even care to check the quality or any other stuff even once, and everyone's now at the dinner table, waiting to start eating once I start the movie, all eyes on the screen and I hit play, the movie started with some weird Chinese credits, I didn't find anything wrong because well a Pokémon movie can have Chinese studios working on it, and then a loud moan was heard, it was freaking Hentai, all nude, the movie had a opening sex scene and then I immediately closed the laptop but I'm still feeling so stupid the whole awkward silence family moment and I'm an brown guy. 

TL;DR I fired up a movie downloaded from torrent without checking at dinner with my family, thinking it to be Detective Pikachu, and the movie was a hentai video.

TIFU By poisoning my family with green potatoes,t2_2i4n6kkv," So as if the cheesecake incident wasn't bad enough, I tried to make mashed potatoes last week and made both of my parents sick. For a little bit of background, I like to bake more than I like to cook, and I know more about baking than cooking.

So we had five potatoes that'd been in the kitchen for about ten or so days and I decided I'd use them to make mashed potatoes. I'd never made mashed potatoes from scratch before, but I knew what I needed so I thought it'd be great. So I cut them up and boil them, then comes the first set back. I can't find the masher. No big deal, I decided I'll chop them up more finely and use a hand whisk and fork to mix them with my butter and milk.

At this point my dad comes home and asks what I'm doing. I tell him and let him taste the potatoes (which I was still trying to mix at this point). He says they taste undercooked, so I decide okay no big deal, and pop them in the microwave for a while. This goes on until I've microwaved these potatoes for about ten minutes (I'd boiled them for about 40 minutes to begin with). By now they look good, and to me they taste edible to me. Admittedly they weren't great, but I figured it was just a lack of butter and salt (combined with the fact they'd been microwaved so much), so I add some more of each and I'm satisfied.

My parents both try the potatoes again and say the same thing, they smell and taste green. At this point I'm convinced they are not undercooked, so now I'm out five potatoes and about an hour and half over all. I ended up eating a scope of them myself (And I could taste what they meant about the green, though I couldn't smell it.) and throwing the rest away. I wish that'd been the end of it.

The rest of the night and next day both my parents feel sick to their stomach, are having slight diarrhea, and have headaches. I felt perfectly fine, and since I ate the most of the potatoes my first assumption wasn't the potatoes were to blame. Then I looked up if green potatoes were safe to eat... and lucky me they aren't. Apparently they have solanine, which can make people dangerously sick.

TL;DR: I made my parents sick with solanine and I guess my body just told it to fuck off since I've been perfectly fine.",41
TIFU by dropping my airpod pro in a bowl of shit,t2_1o3i3h4u,"well yeah. legit happened like an hour ago. the title pretty much explains it. but i just got done taking one of the biggest shits of my life. i stood up and then i turn around to flush the toilet to finish my time in the bathroom and go about my day. now idk who here has airpods but they can fall out of your ears like a motherfucker. especially if you move a decent amount. the moment i flushed the toilet one of my airpod pros plopped right out of my ear and straight into the bowl filled with swirling shit. now i am sad to admit this isn’t the first time these have fallen in the toilet. however, there was no saving this airpod. i didn’t even try to (obvious reasons). i watched in horror and accepted my fate as this ridiculously expensive listening device said farewell to me and my left ear and hello to the world of no return. not that exciting but dude i really miss that airpod already. 

TL;DR: dropped my airpod in a bowl of shit and it was too late to save it",52
TIFU by sous viding the baby,t2_15qygu,"A few years ago when me and my wife's baby was about 5 months old, my wife decided to go out for the evening with her girlfriends. This was the first time she had gone out since the birth and basically since the pregnancy, so she was really excited and I was happy for her. She was understandably a bit hesitant to leave the baby but she knew I would take care of him as we had both gotten really good at doing.

After she left, everything starting out pretty much the same as always. Our baby was well into weaning at that point and he loved trying new foods, so dinners were always a nice experience, even when a fistful of food would occassionally find its way somewhere across the room. When I went to give him his bath though, everything started to go wrong.

The hot water in the house wasn't working when I tried to run the bath. It was working earlier that day so the problem was very unexpected and very frustrating. I obviously didn't want to give him a cold bath, nor did I want to forget the bath altogether (although perhaps I should have). It was at that point I had what I still consider to be an amazing, genius idea: the sous vide machine.

For anyone who doesn't know what a sous vide is, it's a kind of cooking machine that you place into a bath of water and it raises the temperature of the water to the exact temperature you want. We had gotten it as a gift several years before but barely ever used it, so perhaps now was the ideal opportunity. The sous vide came with a plastic water bath that was actually a perfect size for a baby, and so I filled it up with cold water and set the temperature to exactly 37.5°c. A few minutes later the temperature was just right so I gave him his little pre-wash and then in the sous vide he went.

He didn't seem to really notice or care about this new bath of his, and to be honest the only real difference I noticed was that he was now sploshing water around the kitchen instead of the bathroom. Seeing him in the sous vide was pretty cute though (I thought), so I decided to snapchat a picture of it to my wife. She saw the picture of it pretty much instantly and replied normally with a bunch of laughing emojis. And that was it, just a cute little moment I thought.

But apparently not. When my wife got home she was quite upset. I asked her what was wrong and she said that one of her friends had seen the picture I sent and started freaking out, asking if I was an abuser who tortured her and our kid. At first my wife thought it was a joke but her friend was far from messing around. After a few minutes she got pretty hysterical and demanded that my wife speak to the police or a social worker or anyone who could help. Eventually my wife just left crying. I thought the whole thing was completely bizarre.

My wife's friend eventually calmed down and the two of them are still friends. Apparently she still occassionally asks if I'm a sadistic psychopath though. Whenever me and her see each other I can always sense this cold disapproving look in her eye too, like she's a private detective trying to sus me out. I've grown to find it pretty funny over the years actually. Still, if she ever comes over for dinner I think the sous vide should probably stay in the cupboard.

TL;DR - I decided to use a sous vide machine to bathe my baby because the hot water was broken, snapped a picture of it to my wife, her friend saw it and now thinks I'm a psychopath.",1292
TIFU by showing my family my reddit account,t2_5hhicmpx,"tl;dr my muslim family knows I post hentai

im 14 btw

Ok so recently Ive been really into the game overwatch and Ive been in a dispute with my brother about which game is harder: overwatch vs rocket league. As you can see on my profile I just made a post with a question about a character in overwatch and got tons of crazy in depth responses. I wanted to show this to my brother/family to prove how crazy overwatch can get.

I had to be cautious about this since as you can also see on my profile im a pretty avid hentai poster. So, I hid all of my posts. My understanding of hiding posts is that you still keep you karma and the posts still show up on subreddit results but they wont appear when someone looks at your profile. Turns out thats not how it works and the posts only dont appear when you look at your OWN profile.

Problem is, I discovered this after I sent the overwatch posts to the family group chat. So now my muslim family knows their 14 year old son posts hentai on reddit, and I am in alot of trouble.",68
TIFU by Showing my boss at my new job a D pic,t2_mba5n,"Sooo... this happened yesterday. I started a new job working as a doormen at a bar.  My new boss, who was also the one who hired me, was showing me around. Telling what's expected of me and how they expect me to handle drunk people.  I have 17 years experience and he joked there's nothing to really show or teach me because I've been doing it longer than him.  We both laughed, then started talking about life.  He asked about my life is going.

I told him about a new girl I was seeing and told him about how awesome she is.  I then pulled out my phone to show him a pic we just took the other day.  Andddd here's where I f*ucked up.  You see, When you click on your phones gallery it brings up the last picture you viewed.  And the last pic I took, sent, then forgot about was a Dick Pic to this new girl. (She's very sexual and asked to see it before I went to work.  She thought it would be fun to send me nudes on my 1st day at my new job)

So I open my gallery.  And there it is...  A non filtered, make up and effects free pic of my penis. I freaked out slamming the phone into my chest while screaming ""SHITTTT!""  I must've turned pale white and bright red at the same time.  I was mortified!  I couldn't believe what just happened. Trying to think fast and hoping he didn't see anything I bring up the cute pic of her, show him, then throw my phone back into my pocket as fast as possible. 

Now hoping nothing was scene and I was fast enough to catch this I go on about my day.  At the end of his shift, while the night guys are coming in, day guys are getting off, and I'm right in the middle of everyone I'm just meeting the boss goes ""Hey guy's! This is (name).  He just showed me a picture of his dick"". And then walked out laughing hysterically. 

TLDR: Tried to show my new boss at my new job a picture of a girl I'm seeing. Showed him my dick.",578
TIFU by drawing a swastika,t2_lo8egwr,"Disclaimer: Ok, I have been wondering for a few weeks now if I should post this, I even thought about doing it on an alt account because I don't know how people will react but fuck it I'm going hardcore. Keep in mind that I'm very against war, the Nazi movement, the holocaust and anything related to those.

This happened somewhere between 2009 and 2010, I was 9 back then, and I wasn't even a stupid kid, I was actually kinda smart but never had any interest in wars and I hadn't learned anything about WW2 in school so I knew nothing about nazis, Hitler or anything that happened.

I had just receive a laptop a year ago, it actually belonged to my mom but she didn't use it. Eventually I joined a forum where I met this girl, we started an online relationship which I regret today but as a kid with no maturity, being in a relationship was pretty tempting.

Anyway, she broke my heart in a messed up way. After we started dating, she suddenly disappeared for 2 months, one day I find out she came back and was dating a guy that was my friend on that same forum. Having no one to talk to about it I decided to just write it all on paper.

My parents were against me talking to strangers online so I didn't want them to see the letter, so I had to hide it.

I don't usually have posters on my room but at that time I had one poster about a Sonic game on my wall. I decided to hide the letter behind that poster. For some reason I was really good at turning a piece of paper into an envelope with some origami-trickery magic whatever.

So I made an envelope, put the letter inside it but the envelope was too simple so I decided to decorate it and stupid me realized ""you know what? This weird symbol (swastika) looks pretty sick"" so I drew it on the envelope.

A few weeks passed and one day my mom was cleaning my bedroom, she hit the poster and the envelope fell down.
My mom is the kind of parent that respects my privacy so she didn't open the letter.

Back then I was pretty relieved because she didn't read it, she would get so pissed off if she knew I was talking to strangers online, during my adolescence I never understood why my mom sometimes said she was scared of me until recently when it finally struck me, it was because she saw the envelope and she thought that I was some sort of neo Nazi or whatever, I kinda wish she had read the letter now.

TLDR: Stupid me as a kid wrote a letter about a girl I met online, my parents would kill me if they knew I talked to strangers online so I hid it inside an envelope and drew a swastika on it because I didn't know what it was and I just thought it looked cool, my mom found out and she didn't read the letter inside so she was scared of me during my adolescence.",16
TIFU by listening to Motown,t2_2qbfynl7,"Ok so this was a while ago but I heard this song and it reminded me of it. Several years ago I was going out with this girl I met on OK Cupid. I was head over heels for her and as I soon was to find out, her not so much. 

One of our shared interests was Motown music so anytime I was driving I had it playing in the car. One day we go out for lunch and she tells me she wants to break it off, of course she does this right after we order so now we’re stuck there for an uncomfortable amount of time. Of course I needs to drive her back home now (in traffic nearly an hour which is just great).

We get in the car and I turn it on and guess what the song that starts playing. Marvin Gaye’s Let’s Get it on. One of the sexiest songs of all time. After that distinctive sting began we both knew what it was looked at each other &amp; I just said “Nope” and shut the radio off. Not changed the song or station, just off. We sat in silence the entire time which was the cherry on the top of this experience. 8/10 day would recommend it again

TL;DR the music gods played the sexiest song right after an awkward breakup",14
TIFU by snapping at my girlfriend for complimenting me,t2_9qtnwn15,"Ok, so, I've been seeing this girl for the past sixteen months. She's extremely pretty and skinny, which makes me feel insecure because I'm...not. I'm like 30lbs overweight, and much heavier than her. To be fair a lot of it is in my ass and boobs, but there's a lot in my belly as well.

Anyway, my girlfriend has never been judgemental of me, but some others have- I feel all puffy and clumsy when I'm with her. I'venever told her this, and I don't think we've ever discussed my weight. When we're flirting/complimenting each other/having pillow talk, however, she'll call me things like ""curvy"" and ""thicc"", and ""voluptuous"", or compliment my t&amp;a, or say how soft my body is. Usually I laugh this off but it makes me feel fat, even though I know it's meant nicely.

Anyway, today I couldn't fit in to my biggest pair of fat pants, AND had to cut my toenailed (never fun experience for an insecure fat girl), so I was feeling especially big. And then she (not knowing this context) told me ""if I was any more curvaceous there'd be two of me)

It was meant to be flirty banter. But I yelled at her for it. A lot. Until she started crying.

Feeling (ironically) very very small right now 

TL;DR, I took my insecurities over my appearance out on someone who was just being nice to me, and feel very silly.",12
TIFU by spending my entire day programming because I thought that deadline for programs was half a year earlier than it is.,t2_3gt7xiux,"So I am learning python in a place called “Yandex Lyceum” where employees of Russian alternative to google “yandex” help you study programming. There is a ranking system and in order to get to second year you need to have at least 45 points. About a week ago I saw a “deadline in less than 6 days” above every program. And I was at just 12 points! So I spent each day of past week solving at least 12 programs. The reason I am posting this here is because today I went an extra mile and spent 11 hours programming because deadline is in 1 and a half days. After I realised I was too tired to continue I checked the ranking and I was at 32.76 points. The problem is, I solved about 93 % of programs and the rest don’t give a lot of points. So there is no way all programs add up to 45. I made some research, and do you know what I found? THAT THE DEADLINE I SAW WAS FOR FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. I completely forgot that there was going to be another half a year after 12th of January, which means that my whole effort was basically useless since there are about 100 more points, probably at least 20 of which from my experience are going to be basic programs we are going to see solution for on the lessons. 

TLDR:

I thought that deadline for my programming lessons was in a week so I spent a lot of hours programming to not get expelled when it turned out that it was actually in half a year.",66
TIFU (Fake Name/Broken Hearts),t2_pqdpia1,"So to start off this with some context. I’m in a more obscure part of the Pokémon community called the Shiny Hunting Community. It’s basically where we take our free time and hunt for shiny Pokémon. Now keep in mind that this is a close-knit and bonded community. It’s not uncommon for us to meet up and hang out with each other. At least the ones who have known each other for years.

When I was 16, I first entered the bigger part of the community, the Discord server. Everyone knew my name and such, but there was one problem: I couldn’t take a joke, I was overly sensitive, and I took being teased as being harassed. I left the community for a bit, becoming a lot more mature than I was. 

I was ready to come back to the community; afraid that they would still see me as the same, immature person I was a year prior. So what do I do? Give myself a pseudonym (fake name). That’s all, I didn’t change anything else. 

Throughout the year (17-18yo), I was going by this alias, having a good time, and making a lot of friends. While doing so, one of the guys caught feelings for me. He confessed it to me in front of the entire server, if I weren’t so intent on keeping my secret, I probably would’ve fell for him too. He was very sweet. People would tease him about it and constantly. I never joined in on it, but I never did anything to stop it. He left the server while I was away on hiatus because of it. Only now do I realize how awful I was to him. While it made me uncomfortable to say the least, I didn’t do anything when I should’ve. He was always saying he wanted to be closer to me, to meet me, and how it hurt him that we weren’t closer. 

I eventually went on hiatus again for while, wanting to share my secret, but I was always unsure of how everyone would act. I eventually told a close friend the truth, and he encouraged me to tell the others. Fast forward a few months: I do. (18 yo, a year after making a fake name.)

They all just laughed about it, they still call me by the fake name, I like it better. But the guy who had feelings for me took it horribly. He was telling me how horrible a person I was, that I could’ve told everyone sooner, how everyone teased him about “us”, and he’s right, I could’ve told everyone a lot sooner than I did. 

My excuse at the time was: “I had no other choice, I was scared.” Okay, so? I let this go on much longer than it needed to, while it was unintentional, I should’ve stepped in and said something before-hand. I’m pretty sure I destroyed his heart and sense of trust. Only now do I realize I could’ve handled the situation a lot better, said other things, maybe I would’ve still had a friend in the end. I never meant to hurt him the way I did. If I could turn back the clock to fix my horrible mistake, I would. All I know... is I messed up big time. 

TLDR: 
-Joined community and was immature
-came back a year later using a different name
-guy caught feelings for me, community teased him
-I tell the truth a year later. Most of the community is cool, he has a breakdown.
-Name calling, excuses, and a broken heart.",0
TIFU by accidentally sending a LONG text to family that shouldn’t have seen it.,t2_74jxjntf,"Well, TIFU by not paying attention to my Apple Watch. I was sitting and having a venting session to my husband about a family member and how I was frustrated with them. I went into detail about certain situations and explaining the frustration I was feeling and how I didn’t agree with specific things. While this is going on, I keep getting text messages to my Apple Watch. I take a look and it’s a group chat between my two aunts and I. We are very close and they know about this family member and my frustrations but not in detail. Well this is the FU part, unfortunately I went back to speaking to my husband and some how my worst nightmare occurs. Siri was dictating THE ENTIRE conversation and sent it to my group chat. I got up from the table went to charge my watch and when this happened I received two messages from my aunts asking “whatttt?” And “uhh what!?!?” But the problem was I couldn’t see what they were asking about. I asked “what are you guys asking about?” And then this is when my heart dropped out of my asshole. They screen shot the beginning of the message. Mind you, they could only send me this much because it was sooooo long they had to scroll multiple times to even read the message. I didn’t even know text messages could be this long. This message was very detailed and not very nice to say the least. I had to call and explain why I was speaking about these things. It’s all good now but wow my anxiety is so bad and hopefully I will be able to sleep tonight. I’ve learned not to trust my watch at this point. 

My aunts were very gracious and explained to me everyone vents and I couldn’t be more thankful for having such understanding aunts. Even though I’m mortified, it could be worse and could have sent that all to the person I was speaking about. 


TL;DR: my Apple Watch dictated a very long venting conversation and sent it to my aunts.",169
TIFU by smoking weed and having to shit,t2_3qlaoj3n,"Me and my friends had the great idea of smoking bud for the first time, typically it's been carts aka no smell(I know they're ass for you). We were fried as shit and didnt know where to put the leftover weed so we stashed it in my bag. Fast forward to me pulling up to my house. I had had a bad case of munchies and apparently something didnt agree with me cuz I had to shit bad. My dumb ass took my bag in with me for god knows what reason and ran into my dad first thing. I also left my bag in my room while he was fixing my smoke alarm which he definitely smelled it was kinda strong. Anyway he tells me to take a shower because I ""reek of bud"" at this point idk if hes told my other parents (step mom, mom, step dad) or not but he said that wed talk about it in the morning. Ngl kinda scared but I knew this would happen at some point because my friends and I have been so reckless recently. Anyways laugh at my misfortune 👍

TL;DR: smoked weed and had to shit so I rushed in my house with the weed on me and my dad smelled me",4
TIFU by watching porn and ruining my new AirPods,t2_4fj7tcl3,"This happened just a few hours ago, I still feel like a dumbass for it. And probably will for a very long time to come. 

Anyway, I live with a roommate in one house. We’re pretty close and we often just walk into each other’s rooms for a chat or a beer. Which is awesome. The only obvious downside of all that is that it can be hard to get some privacy sometimes. Of course we do the whole sock on the doorknob thing when we’re with someone, but if you just want to “be with yourself” for a while, the only safe option is the shower. 

Today I woke up, drank my coffee, ate my breakfast, and got horny. You know, the usual routine. I always “do my thing” in the shower for privacy reasons. And sometimes I watch porn on my phone during. But almost always without sound so no one can hear me. 

BUT since I had a pretty good month in December, I decided to treat myself to a brand-spanking new set of way too expensive Apple AirPods. I hike a lot, so I figured these would be nice to have for music or podcasts while I walk around. And I was right, they’re awesome! But while they are great for said music or podcasts. They also work great if you want to watch porn (with sound) in the bathroom before you shower, and you don’t want your roommate to hear. 

And that, my dear friends, is exactly what I did. And it was wonderful. It’s been so long since I actually watched porn WITH sound, it made the whole experience exceptionally enjoyable. And with this newly added benefit of sound, I finished my chore rather quickly. I cleaned up, put my phone away and got in the shower. 

The shower was nice. Just like it always is. But, I don’t know, the running water just sounded different. A bit muffled or something. Kinda weird? “Whatever” I thought, as I continued washing myself. It was only after a solid 5/6 minutes of showering, I realized I STILL HAD MY FUCKING AIRPODS IN. shit. 

As I am writing this, my beloved, brand new and very expensive (to me) AirPods are drying in a bowl of rice. They are fucked. I tried them, but they don’t work anymore. I’m hoping they will after drying up. But if they don’t, at least I’ll have a funny, albeit kind of embarrassing story to tell at parties. And to you guys!

TLDR; I watched porn on my phone before my shower. Forgot I was wearing my brand new AirPods. Showered a full 5 min WITH my AirPods in my ear. And now they’re fucked.",69
TIFU by telling my brother and my best friend that I want to kill myself,t2_8ksvthwa,"I don't even know how to begin this but I'm just gonna go for it. First of I'm a 22M just to give a bit of backstory to me. One of other friends decided to have a house party considering all restrictions were lowered and we could gather as a group at a house. 

It was a great night everyone was having a good time and enjoying themselves until a certain part in the night. I drank a lot of alcohol very quickly and I guess it all hit me at once. I'm a shy guy pretty quiet and keep to myself but all my friends are  open about pretty much everything. Hearing stories about some of the stuff they have done kinda shocked me I'm pretty close with my brother and friends but yeah it kinda shocked me a little bit.

The past couple of years of been having a problem within myself not thinking that I'm good enough or that I'm missing out in life because of how I act. I guess I just have an issue with comparing myself to people too much whether it's about relationships or work success etc.

I don't really remember what I exactly said but basically I sat down and told one of my best friends that I wanted to kill myself, no one will care if I'm gone, my life is meaningless and that I'm useless.

I've never opened up to any of my friends about this because it doesn't really come across in my mind that often. A few times last year I tried punching myself in the head to feel better and I got caught by my parents but within a few days I was fine and didn't worry about for months. Killing myself isn't something I think about regularly and I've never even attempted it but it's still not good that somewhere in my head it might come out sometimes.

I don't know what I triggered all those emotions my guess is that it was a mix of the alcohol and just hearing everything. As of right now I can't even look at an alcoholic drink without feeling sick in my stomach.

I fucked up and felt so bad because my friend that I told got upset and started crying and blaming himself and him and my brother want me know to see a therapist so that I can talk to someone who knows what they're doing. I don't really want to talk someone as I'm absolutely terrified of talking to someone and wouldn't even know where to start or even look for one but maybe it'll help.

TL:DR got drunk at a party, heard some stories about my friends, told my best friend I wanted to kill myself.",8
TIFU by almost killing my dad with popcorn,t2_2vt3r2xj,"So for y'all to know my dad has been through serious covid case and is now recovering. He has problems with breathing and we live in quite small house.

 So it happened today. I was making some microwave popcorn and on the package it said to put it in for around 2 to 3 minutes on 800w power.

So I put the popcorn in set the timer and waited. When the popcorn was ready I took it out and it seemed like it wasn't quite ready because there wasn't much popcorn in the bag so I put it back for around a minute.

When I took it out again a lot of smoke came out of microwave. I burnt the popcorn. Remember when I said we live in quite small house? There was so much smoke that it was very hard to breathe even for me (I am healthy and don't have problems with breathing). 

So the smoke got to the other room where my dad was and he couldn't breathe. I had to open all the windows in my house so my dad could get to some fresh air.

He was sitting by the window for maybe 10 minutes. We were even considering calling an ambulance because it was so bad.

TL;DR: my dad almost suffocated in smoke because I burned the popcorn.",34
TIFU by almost setting the house on fire.,t2_17b4ly,"This just happened 5 or so minutes ago.

I’m currently celebrating my birthday by having a friend over. We were sitting at our table, enjoying our cake and ice cream, when I had the bright idea to put a paper napkin over a lit candle with two wicks. The first time I did it, it put one of the wicks out, and the second one left some soot or something on the napkin.

The third time is where the FU occurs. I did it again, but this time I noticed that the napkin got brighter, and lifted it to see that it was on fire! I raced over to the other side of the kitchen with it, where my sister and I tried to blow it out. My friend was able to step on the last bit on fire to put it out, but his shoe was melted in the process. I guess I won’t be living this one down for a *long* time.

TLDR: I decided to put a paper napkin over a lit candle, and that went about as you would expect, but on the 3rd try.",2
TIFU by catching porn on an Apple employee's laptop (This isn't a personal TIFU moment),t2_65y0271d,"I came into the Apple store to give my iPhone for repair. The guy asked for my invoice, and I bought the product off Amazon. I asked him if I could use his laptop and he said yes (he was on the other side of the desk so he basically flipped the laptop on my end). I opened up an incognito window on Chrome as I did not want to deal with the whole log-out-later shebang. I saw ""Incognito (2)"", which meant that another incognito window was open. Out of sheer curiosity, I checked the windows, and guess what. Xvideos. Video paused. The amount of second hand embarrassment I felt was unreal. Then suddenly he remembered that he had it open so he quickly took the laptop from me, and I saw him closing the window. After that, he basically died inside. So did I. It made for a very, very awkward interaction, he didn't speak much after that and his cheeks were blood red. Oh well lmao

TL;DR I caught porn on an Apple employee's laptop when I came in and we both died inside.",40
Tifu by dumping out beside my car.,t2_1iheq80b,"If can tell the TL;DR is the title. So on with the story. 
On mobile full naive English speaker just shitty speller. 


On Thursday, not today sorry, I was running around chasing after a road crew and I screwed up the address so by the time I got there the work was already started and I couldn’t go pee like I wanted too. Not that I could, it would be beside the car with a beautiful view of a Vineyard behind me, so I quickly threw on my gear and went to the foreman. About 20 minutes later my supervisor showed up because one person I had worked with had dropped off my jacket at the office and I couldn’t make it in to the office to grab it. I asked my supervisor to bring it to me and if she could also drop off some extra time sheet books for me. Anyways I thought perfect now is my chance! I asked my supervisor to take over I run to my car and I throw my jacket and my time cards in as I do the urge to pee is strong so in one swift move and yes my door was open I dropped into a squat a powered pissed by my car. Now your thinking “that’s it?” No, well that morning I had my XL coffee from McCrap’s and a blended blueberry and pomegranate smoothie it had decided it was a good idea to make a quick crash course though my gut. Because the force of gravity and my lower half being at a perfect 90 angle my bowels went  

“RELEASE THE KRAKEN!” 

Unable to stop it, I let it happen, because my car. It was gross and nothing but an old McDonald’s bag to wipe with. It was like one ply concrete. After I cleaned up as best as I could and I didn’t have any hand sanitizer, I pulled up my pants up and thought I had covered my poop like a kitty in a littler box and put my McDonald’s bag over it. Little did I know the horror that was moments away from unfolding. 

I went back to my supervisor swapped out said bye and she drove off, only she turned into the driveway that I had my bruised McDonald’s turd, she turned her car around and drove off. Thinking that was the end of it. 

I went on lunch not long ago and got a message from my supervisor about littering on the job site. Considering the crime, this was an ok punishment.",3
TIFU by crying over being hurt,t2_8j5jjdv5,"Ok, so first off, I wanna clarify: my dad yells at me for the stupidest shit EVERY WEEK. I just thought this was special.

&amp;#x200B;

While i was cleaning my room, i accidentally hit the inside of my kneecap on a tabletop, because I was being clumsy, while trying to get out of my 6 month old puppy's way, and of course I cry about it. How can you NOT cry over hitting your leg on a tabletop when you have weak nerves? Ok, now back to the story. I grab my leg, hop like a kangaroo while it's try to imitate a flamingo, all the way to the living room, and my mom says ""WOAH HEY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?"" And I tell her I hit my knee on the tabletop. My father comes in and says this: ""STOP CRYING BECAUSE YOU GOT HURT, I GO THROUGH MORE PAIN THAN YOU EVERY DAY, WUSS!"" I would like to clarify this,

IM NOT AS TOUGH AS MY DAD.

My mother who has Addison's disease, was stressed out to the extreme, and was tired, since my dad also wakes her up when he wakes up. My mother just said this when the yelling fest ended:

""Just please, don't cry, it stresses me out to the extreme, and gets us into arguments with him.""

tl;dr: I fucked up by crying over hitting my leg into a tabletop while my dad was there.",11
TIFU by committing third degree vehicular fishicide. (Uhh.. short? Ish?),t2_pby42lc,"I was visiting my uncle’s farm with my sister, my mom and her husband. I was mostly there to visit their animals (they have a mini donkey.. and this creepily-too-friendly little goat that tried to follow me into their house) , because family banter in my neck of the woods is about as pro-cheeto as you can get, and it’s the same old same old. They had my 9 year old cousin programmed to say “I love Tr*mp! He’s better than Lyin’ Biden! That creep!” like one of those old pull-the-string to talk toys (she really believed it, though) and that says enough. She also regaled my sister and I with the tale of Mermgleskofen, or some weird norse word that she seemed very intent on letting us know it meant “Little Black Boy”, her prize-winning angus beef steer. We got to see him in all his meaty glory. She was... so proud.. of him. 

ANYWAY, I crack open a couple twisted teas to cope with the poor decision making that brought me to even ATTEMPTING to engage in some kind of fulfilling conversation with these guys. Now - these weren’t any twisted teas - my uncle’s wife’s friend (who I totally think shags both of them on the regular because they were looking at each other real odd and weirdly kinda flirting after getting about six or so beers ahead of me but let’s not talk about that) brought them in, complaining about how freezing she was from the cold from the horseback ride she went on over her huge 100 acre property! So, naturally, someone tells her to get a better coat. Ironically, now, she responds - “I am one broke [racial slur!], I can’t buy no Carhartt!” You.. you..you literally were just talking about riding a horse you own on 100 acres of your own property. Owning a horse is expensive, but.. come on. 

Anyway, this warrants a couple more teas. I’m balls deep into four cans by now, and then. 

Here it comes..

The love of my life. The absolute best time I will ever have. My little cousin comes scooting in from some corner of the house on this absolute beauty of modern technology: A hoverboard with an attachment that turns it into a gokart, blasting God’s Country by Eric Church thanks to the nifty bluetooth speakers. (With matching lights) Like a sweet and cherubic future-goblin angel, she drifts a corner around the table and into the living room and asks, “Wanna drive it?” 

So of course, I’m like “Oh you betcha” and to my inebriated bliss, I am whipping absolute shitties in the living room on this blessing of modern ingenuity. HAVING A BLAST. I felt like a real formula one racer, tokyo drift mode.. I will spend my life chasing this high. And then it happened.. I was very swiftly reminded why DUI’s exist. One wrong movement and I send the cart (and my ass) at Mach 10 into the living room table, causing what one might call a small seismic event inside my cousin’s 50 gallon fish tank. Nothing was *too* terribly disturbed, but all I’m going to say is twenty minutes later (after I decided drunk hoverkarting may not have been the brightest plan), my cousin was staring very intently at the fish tank asking, “Dad, why is he sleeping on the pebbles?”

Uncle very curtly inspects the tank, and says, “Oh, that fucker is dead.” 

Meanwhile I’m sitting in a corner, smiling and minding my own business. Uhhh yeah, haha!  I dunno what happened there! 

TL;DR: Go to a small family dinner party, get drunk to deal with discourse, end up driving a hoverboard gokart into a fishtank and indirectly killing a fish.",0

Tifu by getting to drunk,t2_96bcsuyk,"Tifu by getting too drunk. 

Last night I took my normal dose of muscle relaxers for muscle spasms and they make 1 drink affect my body as if I had about 2-3. This allows me to get really drunk really fast but also sober up really quickly. I've been talking to a girl off and on for about a year now and the other day she sent me a special picture and things have been going good. I actually kinda really like this girl and really embarrassed myself. I drank a full glass of whiskey in two drinks so that's about 5 normal shots or about 11ish drinks on me. I decided to send her a message while absolutely shit faced. It wasn't offensive it was just way too much. I apologized for it but she's barely talked to me today and I feel like I really fucked it up. She was supposed to come over for dinner tonight but for other reasons I had to cancel (yay having shitty roommates who don't care about your plans) and hopefully she'll be coming over tomorrow night for dinner and a movie but idk now because of my stupidity. I just wish I could take it back or pretend it didn't happen. I know my best option if she's not really wanting to talk as we were or come over is to just wait and things will get better but I don't want to wait and maybe miss out on having some sort of relationship with her. 


Tldr got really drunk and sent a really long message to a girl I really like and embarrassed myself with it.",2
TIFU by railroading my DMs campaign by introducing a new character,t2_9gaemufu,"Ok so technically this happened Wednesday but it’s coming to light today. We’ve been playing this campaign since June and the previous session we just interrupted the BBEGs evil plan. Since we hit a nice lull, I told my DM offline that I wanted to try out a new character for a bit. The character was intended to be a tragically untrustworthy character who suffered from D.I.D. with the redeemable quality as a remarkable ranger. Well the overall effect came off poorly because as soon as my character was introduced I had to take a pause to hop on an online work meeting. When I came back 40 minutes later, the story had moved on, albeit in an innocuous way. I walked into the potion shop they had been talking in and felt inserted and out of place due to the time lapse.  It was a rough beginning and my previous character’s disappearance had been explained by going missing. He was kidnapped but no one in the party was privy to this knowledge. We set out to look for him with pretty much no clues to follow. “Not an issue” I thought. I’m a ranger. Well a few bad rolls later and we are hopelessly off track and I do not have the bearings I thought I did. This causes a huge argument in the party and the commander of the mercenary group we just started working for steps in. Well the party starts arguing with him and we all get fired on the spot. Now the party is mad at me.

TL;DR: Introduced a new character that got off to a rough start. Bad rolls and general unpleasantness caused an argument in the party that caused us to get fired from the mercenary group we just started with",7
Tifu by showing my family a short video of me fingering my girlfriend.,t2_h9071,"Edit: Extemporaneous typing.

TL;DR: watch the Apple memories of 2020 videos by yourself first. 

This happened about 45 minutes ago.

So... anyone that has an Apple device may have noticed they do these “memory videos” for 2020. Anyways, I had just discovered this feature and was watching it with my girlfriend. Slowly, other immediate family members joined around us after having heard the “chill” music played along the montage.

We saw some cute pictures of our pets, museums visits pre-COVID, my GF and I spotting deer, us decorating our new apartment, time spent at my moms house, visits to forest preserves, and other no contact activities we did this summer and fall.

Then it happened. About 3 minutes into the montage it shifted from a picture to a short clip of me sliding 2 fingers into my girlfriends vagina. Time froze. Someone said, “Oh my” in the tone of an antebellum age southern lady, and I whipped my phone down. People walked away, but a proverbial fly on the wall would have collided with the amount tensions in the air, which would require more than a knife to cut.

I’m now home laying in bed typing this and thinking about how 30 years from now, this is going to be one of those embarrassing memories that keep me up at night.",66059
TIFU and my son is mad at me. TLDR at end.,t2_146rz0eb,"Shortly after Christmas my son called and told me he would be visiting in the new year.  Awesome.  He said he'd stay about a week, also awesome.  I love him dearly, and am just getting to know his new wife and I like her a lot.  It really is good to get to see them.  I must have misunderstood when they'd be arriving, because I wrote down the 6th or 7th.  I got a text on the 30th saying they were at the halfway point.  OMG whoopsie!  Okay, all well and good.  

We had an awesome week.  I was able to make most of his favorite meals, and even learned to make real tacos (not the old el paso junk) and enchiladas.   Thanks to his wife.  It was all good... until...

They were to leave on Thursday morning early, so we had to say our goodbye on Wednesday night.   On the way out I said something to the effect of ""this was great, but I don't want to see you for about 6 months "".  He asked why (of course) and I said that we (husband and i) needed at least that long to make a significant attempt at our diets.  He argued that we could have found recipes to satisfy both.  I tried to backpeddle but it wasn't enough.  I saw the hurt on his face and I'm sorry.

What I was thinking, and what he heard were 2 vastly different things. 

Way back at the beginning of quarantine I imagined that without seeing people I could ""emerge as a butterfly"".  Well, by Christmas I had gained a lot of weight.  I emerged as a slug.  

When I thought he would be here on the 6th, I thought that I would be a week into my diet and we would just make do with meals.  But when he arrived on the 31st, I... underscore I, decided to just postpone the start by a week.  

By saying that I didn't want him here for 6 months was just me trying to get on my diet without an excuse, not blaming him for a week of excessive eating.   I also mildly disapprove of the money he's wasting by coming all that way, staying at hotels, eating out.  I would so much rather he save his money.

To add insult to injury,  a few minutes after he left, I let out a little fart and said to my husband ""gee, that's the first fart in the living room in a week"" we laughed, but then he took my phone (he didn't have the right number on his) and texted the incident to my son.  No reply.  In hindsight, oof.   It must have sounded like we were glad he was gone.  I just don't know his wife well enough to feel comfortable with emitting bodily noises yet.

I hope he reads this.  I am so sorry for saying those insensitive words.  I love it when you visit.  You are never an imposition.   You've said often that you want to support my weight loss... even offered me cash per pound, offered to buy me one of those watch things that monitor everything... all I really need is time.  You are a wonderful son, husband, and person.  I am so proud of you, and I want you to be proud of me.

TL;DR made my son think that I don't want him to visit by saying that I didn't want to see him for 6 months.",9
TIFU by flossing.,t2_6lajqvk,"TIFU by flossing. Actually, 4 days ago IFU by flossing. 


I got a beautiful set of knives for Christmas. They’re very sharp, and I absolutely love them. I love them so much, I don’t really want to risk them being damaged by hard water in the sink or dishwasher. Anyways, obviously I had to hand wash these beauties. 

When I was putting them into their little knife home, I managed to slide my finger across one (the cleaver, yay) and got quite a chunk sliced out of my finger. My index finger- on the outside, just under the knuckle. (Location is important)

It’s somewhat healed-ish today, so I take off my band aid to give it some air. I probably should have had it looked at but I didn’t, Oh whale. Anyways, I’m getting ready for bed...I wash my face, all that. Brush my teeth. Mouthwash. And then I floss. Without even thinking, I suit up my floss the way I always do....Wrap around and go to town. 

As I’m standing there at the mirror, it was the blood dripping that caught my eye. Damn! I must have taken the bandaid off soon...then I felt it. I felt the mint. I felt the mint, in my cut and everything came together.

The mint was actually searing pain from tightly double wrapping the Minty floss into my fresh, deep wound. It’s been a couple days and I still feel that minty burn. 


TL;DR: today I fucked up by flossing.",11
TIFU by inhaling ants,t2_9keiq5zc,"This happened a few years ago. I was traveling in Nepal with a group from my college. We were spending about 3 weeks helping out at a school there doing teaching, construction, agriculture stuff, and whatever else needed to be done. 

Public education in the area wasn’t very good so this school was considered a sort of tuition-free private school. In order to function, it ran largely on volunteers from both the surrounding area and from around the world. For volunteers who didn’t live in the area, there was a large, shared bunkhouse of sorts. The bunkhouse was made out of mud bricks and had two floors. It had windows but the windows didn’t have glass in them so rats, bugs, etc could be an issue sometimes. It was also just generally pretty grimy. 

The first day we get there, I pick a sleeping spot near one of the windows. I set all of my stuff down and unpack a little, including a small toiletry bag I use to hold my toothbrush and medications when I’m traveling. The windowsill is pretty wide and makes a good shelf so I set the toiletry bag down there. 

Fast forward to that evening. It’s about 3am and we had all been sitting and chatting around a campfire for most of the evening. I had a bad cold and had run out of tissues so I figured it was time to go to bed.  I went upstairs in the bunkhouse, grabbed my toiletry bag, and brought it back outside to a little external sink area to brush my teeth and do my meds. 

I have pretty bad asthma, so I take an inhaled corticosteroid twice a day. At this point I just do it on autopilot before brushing my teeth. 

I’m standing outside at the sink, wearing a headlamp so I can roughly see what I’m doing, and take my inhaler. As I breath in, I feel a couple small somethings fly into my mouth. I don’t think it’s a huge deal because every so often, a little dirt will get in the inhaler. I decide to look anyway though and see that the mouthpiece of the inhaler is absolutely CRAWLING with ants. 

My sleep deprived, sick brain decides that I need to go to bed as soon as possible and instead of freaking out like I would have thought, I handle the situation surprisingly logically. I give a couple good coughs to make sure any ants are out of my lungs and gnash my teeth around a bit to make sure any ants in my mouth are good and dead. After rinsing with some water, I squished all the ants I could reach with my finger in the mouthpiece of the inhaler and rinsed that out too. I brushed my teeth, went to bed, and continued using the inhaler for the next month.  I stored my toiletry bag under like 5 layers for the rest of the trip and kept everything far away from the windowsill. 

TL;Dr: I accidentally inhaled ants because I didn’t think about where I set down my inhaler.",3
TIFU by trying to be sexy for my bf,t2_ki9375b,"My boyfriend (J) and I are super sexual but we are also trolls. Every week, he has a live DJ stream. During these streams, I sit right next to the camera, not in the line of view but just to the side of it. I love to show my support! SOMETIMES, I also love to troll and I love to get my sexual needs satisfied. What does this mean? I’ll dress in some sort of lingerie or expose myself so he gets to only sometimes glance at me (typically, as he streams, he rarely disconnects from the camera) aka only sometimes look and no touching. Basically, I’ll dress up and chill there while he finishes his set, just to be a tease and be funny and sexy and whatever the fuck reason. 

Anyway, I go get dressed about 15 mins before I know he’s going to finish his set. Today’s outfit is literally barely anything. It’s a brand new fit and he’s never seen it before. I don’t really wanna say what the outfit is but it’s prob best that I explain it so you can truly understand how embarrassing this is. It isn’t your typical lingerie. It’s black stockings with just a belt garter, like vajayjay less and ass less. I think you’re suppose to wear this with some sort of panties like a thong but I didn’t. So nothing covering my goodies. And then “x” black nipple pasties. AND I felt like that was too plain, so I had also put in a purple gemmed butt plug, also brand new. Pretty much, wearing nothing.

I show up to the room, sit down next to the camera, definitely not in view of the stream, and he catches a glimpse of me. J decides to end the stream early (yay me!), puts on the last song, and turns off his streaming camera. And then I get up and hug him.... the twitch camera is off, it’s fine. I turn around, spread my cheeks to show him the brand new plug, and he spanks me. Then we start making out. BUT fucking guess tf what: his IG live story was still ON! He realizes it as we start kissing cuz he looks behind me and saw his phone. He’s on IG live with his phone, as well. fuck! We forgot about this one. Usually IG kicks him off of live within 30 mins of his stream, but for some fuckin reason, it decides to let him stream all the way through. He, gently yet hastily, shoves me off to the side and turns off his phone. I run to the bathroom, freak out a bit, and then come back to the room. 

So what’s the damage? 

He still had 3 viewers. We don’t know who exactly was watching. But J suspected one of his younger cousins was on. Her brother (A) is someone we play video games with damn near every night. So we try to shake it off and say “it is what it is. It’s fine”. But I had a very difficult time doing this cuz my whole ass and titties were just out and about live on camera. I started to contemplate things like “well, do you think they could see my outfit or just my birthday suit? Cuz i mean nakedness is normal but this outfit, with the butt plug, it’s a bit much”. He consoles me and reassures me that everything will be ok. 

We do our deed and then sign on to play video games and A is on and we get into a party with him and he fucking mother fuckin says “hey J. I think I saw something I wasn’t suppose to see”

You know those times in cartoons where a character just melts or slides down a flight of stairs hugging every step? That’s how i felt. I melted on the spot. I was like “we don’t need to talk about that.” This kid is like 21 and we’re in our mid 30s and we interact all the time cuz we play so much. He’s actually one of my favorite teammates. It’s been a week since this has happened and I still think about it. 

I was so mortified. I am still mortified. I actually keep most of my sexual life behind closed doors, as I’m sure most people do. I believe a lot of my sexual tendencies are pretty kinky but they are SO normal and natural to me that this pushes me to be embarrassed by it all. Not quite sure if that makes sense. I think this whole ordeal just really embarrassed me. 

TL;DR: I got dressed up in barely anything lingerie and exposed my whole body, including me spreading my cheeks to show off my butt plug on a live stream",118
Tifu by throwing a ball at my daughters eye,t2_48wglvho,"This happened a month ago. My daughter was outside riding her bike and I was playing fetch with our dog. This is a typical evening on our street. I got a chuck-it wand to run our dog once I got tired of the slobbery mess of a ball I was throwing with my bare hands. So I was playing fetch and one of the throws I tried to bounce the ball really high and I threw it as hard as I could towards the ground. This is we’re i fucked up. 
Instead of bouncing, it went straight and it went straight into my daughters left eye. She was about 50-60 feet away. My daughter is 6 and I have never heard a thud and wail in my entire life. I ran over to her to check on her as she’s just absolutely balling. I have never been so worried about my kids before in my life. I thought I broke her eye socket, made her go blind, gave her a concussion. I mean I was worried. She didn’t cry fo r that long and I was finally able to see her eye and have her tell me what hurts. Once she opened her eye I saw the bottom of her iris completely bloodshot. She was saying she can’t see anything. Now I’m panicking even more thinking I just made my
Kid go blind. I call the wife and tell her what’s going on. We ended up going to see a ophiologist and of course only one can go in and it was my wife since I had to park the car. So I’m waiting at the door for updates and just rethinking the event over and over. Cell service sucked so I barely got updates. But after 5 hours, multiple tests &amp; ct scan they come out. 
Ct scan was fine so no concussion. They gave her steroid and glaucoma eye drops. We were to see an eye doctor in the morning. First visit he said her eye pressure is really really high and he can’t see in the back of the eye to tell if there’s damage because of all the blood. So do the eye drops and come back in a few days. Well each visit the pressure went down but the vision was still blurry. So our 4th visit, last week her vision started becoming clear and he could see her eye. No permanent eye damage!!!!! Man I was so relieved. I felt like I could finally breathe and be somewhat ok with what happened. Yesterday we got the final all clear from the doctor and one more visit in 2 months. I was a wreck the past few weeks and couldn’t help but think of the worst of course but I and my wife are so thankful that her vision is not compromised. 

TL;DR played fetch with my dog, threw the ball at my daughters eye. Thought she went blind but three weeks later her vision was back to perfect. I was able to breathe after that.",12
TIFU by breaking my word in a Russian prison,t2_9q0g518b,"It happened in a Russian prison. In a Penal Colony, to be precise. We celebrated the 2014 New Year on a grand scale - homemade cakes, a lot of salads consisting of everything, and home brew... Lots of home brew. 

The morning of January 1st comes. Everyone is slowly waking up and coming to their senses. Life returns to it's usual groove. A friend comes to visit me. He lives in another barrack. But if careful and imperceptible, it was possible to violate territory of the local sector. He was a good friend; we constantly supported each other. We would share useful things, and sometimes, we stood up for serious conflicts. 

\- Well, have you given up smoking? 

\- What do you mean? - (I did not understand.) 

\- Well, we have agreed to quit smoking together on January 1st. At 23:57 I smoked the last cigarette and that's it. Have you forgotten? 

\- No! Of course I remember! Same shit - I haven't smoked since night. 

I say all this, and feel my face turn red. I had a desire to sink into the floor. I completely forgot about our agreement, and extinguished the last cigarette literally a second before his arrival. We discussed something else, wished eachother a Happy New Year, drank tea  and he left. I remember looking at this cloudy sediment in a mug and realized that this was it. My fucked up shame. It's not when someone laughs at you and says something behind your back, insults you or tries to humiliate you. No. It is a shame to your conscience, character and will. Since that day I have not smoked. I just couldn't afford to be so weak. 

I have been without cigarettes for seven years now, and I am incredibly happy about that. By the way, a friend lit a cigarette two weeks later. I do not blame him. Life too taught me this.

TIFU by accidentally drowning my just-shaved pubic area in vinegar,t2_9pch9de7,"So I've been having a bit of a dandruff in my hair (that on my head, that is) and an itchy scalp. Recently I read that rinsing your hair with vinegar can help with that. So I thought, why not try it, it's cheap and even if it doesn't help it won't hurt, I can always try.

&amp;#x200B;

So I hop under the shower with a bottle of vinegar. Then before I reach for my shampoo, I realise it's also time to do my normal maintenance on my *other* hair - that Down Under - so first I grab the razor and shave my pubes.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, after washing my (head) hair, as normally, with shampoo, I pour the vinegar over my head/hair, let it soak in a little, then rinse it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I realise my mistake when the vinegar hits my freshly-shaven pubic area, which is ON FIRE now (no not in a good way; I mean literally and in a very painful way).

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, it rinses away quickly, but I'll never shave anywhere on my body on the same day I use vinegar on my body again.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. The vinegar did seem to work well on my hair, which feels all fresh (I rinsed the vinegar out well of course so my hair wouldn't smell bad) and shiny, but I still have the dandruff. I'll have to try it a bit longer to see if it helps.

TL;DR Accidentally drowned my just-shaven pubic area in vinegar (because I tried to use vinegar against dandruff on my head and an itchy scalp), and it was PAINFUL.",9
TIFU by spending one hour to troubleshoot a problem that doesn't exist on my laptop,t2_2ssfgw5h," 

I  have a workhorse laptop, recently turned 8 years old, but it stills  serves me well. 5 years ago I replaced the HDD with a great Samsung 850  evo 500GB Sata SSD. This in not an ad, but, god, I love this drive.  Anyway, I have been planning a clean install of Windows to wipe all the junk, and  today was the day.

Backed up  everything, even downloaded any weird driver and app that I want to  install manually, created a bootable USB. Everything in its place. I  start the boot from USB process as usual, and then it hits me. In the  step where you choose partitions, after deleting everything, it only  shows 250 gigs of unallocated space.

WHERE'S  THE OTHER HALF??? My mind is racing, some wacky stuff I recently  downloaded might have broken something, but why didn't the problem  appear the previous days? Maybe the drive is broken, maybe a bug. This  is not what I imagined the day to be. I already start thinking if I have  enough money to get a new 1TB SSD and get done with it, but I don't.

I  start my google search, start downloading tools, searching for that  weird tip hidden in the 3rd page of google search. Nothing works. I open  Device Manager, and it lists my SSD as ""Samsung 850 evo 250GB Sata"". At  this point, I'm sure it's a virus that has permanently damaged my ssd.

Or,  could it be? When could that happened? Maybe... someone stole my ssd  and replaced it with another, all while copying the data so that I don't  find out about it. I open the back of the laptop, unscrew the drive,  and there it is, a Samsung 850 evo 250GB Sata SSD. So... it's really  possible that someone replaced it? The laptop hasn't gone out of the  house for almost a year.

Then I  decide to check the receipt. Log in to the eshop that I had ordered  from, go to my orders history, and there it is. An order for a Samsung  850 evo 250GB Sata SSD drive.

Am I starting to turn insane?

TLDR:  Tried to reinstall windows, I thought I had a 500GB SSD, but I had a  250GB one, and I spent 2 hours trying to fix the problem because I  thought it was infected by a virus and it had lost half capacity.",16
TIFU by tripping at the gym.,t2_1p04r5bt,"Obligatory 'this was not actually today.'

So I used to be a real gym junkie. I had been working with my PT for a year or so at this time. He was a hot, down to earth, fun guy and we worked really well together. Reminded me very much of my cousin. I wasn't intetested in him sexually. I'm normally very clumsy. I have literally fallen over standing still. It's quite a talent really.

One night in our session I'm doing box jumps. For the uninitiated that's just jumping into a platform from a stand. He's standing in front of me. I get to level 4 or so, do my jump... and hit the edge of the platform with my toe. Hands outstretched, I fall forwards. Onto my hot trainers crotch. At the last moment I somehow manage to twist and put my weight onto the hand that landed on the wall.

I was MORTIFIED. I just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me whole. I stood there in shock, eyes cartoonishly wide, staring at the ground. I mumbled an apology. Without missing a beat and with his normal high energy encouragement, he dismissed it and went straight back into the training session.

The next day I was talking about it to the guys at work. I asked if was possible that the trainer was oblivious to the fact I'd come so close to low fiving his hanging fruit. They asked if I felt anything. I hopefully said 'I touched cloth,' thinking I'd gotten away with it. They looked at each other, looked back at me, and simultaneously said 'He knew.'

Tifu by accidentally writing a suicide note,t2_4amoa848,"This actually happened years and years ago when I was in fourth or fifth grade but I just remembered about it today so I thought I’d share. You see, I used to live in a town just outside of St. Louis Missouri, so we were on the very edge of tornado alley. For some reason I developed a strange fascination and fear of tornadoes. I was paranoid, I still get paranoid. Even if there was only a slight thunderstorm, I’d be terrified that there would be a tornado, and throughout my childhood and time living there, I had many nightmares about tornadoes that I still remember to this day. Now that you understand my slightly irrational phobia of tornadoes, this takes place one day at my elementary school. the sky was so dark that it felt like night, and I was in class and could see out the windows at the rain pouring and the lightning and the sky becoming an ominous green color. I wasn’t paying attention because I was so anxious about the possibility of a tornado on its way. Because of this, my child brain had nothing better to do than write a will, just in case I died in the tornado that I was positive was coming. I wrote the will on a notecard which probably went along the lines of ‘my dog goes to my parents, my iPad goes to my little brother, everything else goes to my best friend, goodbye cruel cruel world.’ Yes, I was a very dramatic child. Long story short, no tornado came, at least not that day, and by the end of school the storm had let up and everything was fine. Obviously then, I wasn’t going to die so I no longer needed the will. I recycled the notecard.  A day or so passed when I get called into the counselors office. I had no idea what this was about, for context I was barely aware of what suicide even was at this point in my life. She showed me the notecard and told me that someone had found it in the recycling bin and if I knew what it was. At this point was relived I wasn’t in trouble even though I didn’t understand what was wrong, so I laughed. She told me she was relived I was laughing and I told her the story. That’s basically it, not the most climactic story but for sure embarrassing to look back on.

TL;DR I thought I was going to be killed by a tornado so I wrote a will, my school counselor mistook it for a suicide note.",238
TIFU by doing shrooms with a gay furry,t2_5w7j24yk,"I’m on mobile, so I apologize for any formatting errors on my part in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

Some backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

So this happened a few weeks ago, couple of days before Christmas, actually. I’m on leave (paid vacation in the military), so I text my friend and ask him what he’s up to. I will refer to this friend as B henceforth. I’ve known B for a few years; I met the dude on Omegle several summers ago and we really hit it off. From there, him and I exchanged Discord usernames after a few hours of chatting and quickly developed a friendship online, despite never meeting each other in the flesh and the fact that we had two completely different personalities. We would always play COD together, fuck around with people on Omegle, or just talk. I should mention that B is also a furry. B tells me that he’s free, so we talk about me coming down to visit him and his boyfriend (let’s just call B’s boyfriend Tony from here) for a few days and he thinks that it’d be a great idea, so I book my flight. The next day, I fly down to Tampa and B picks me up. We shoot the shit for a bit, talking about how nice it is to finally hang out, until we arrive at his place. The next few nights are really just partying and getting drunk and B and Tony showing me around Tampa, amongst other shit.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the fuck-up.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I know it, it’s my last night with them, so B decides to bust out the magic mushrooms after some discussion. I tell him I’ve never tried any psychedelics before. He says I’ll be fine. Fuck it. After a bit of research, along with some preparation, I decide that I’m finally ready. I was a bit anxious, and didn’t really know what to expect, but I trusted B nonetheless. He gives me 1.5 grams of what he describes to me as a “gentler strain” mixed in with a smoothie to start me off. I inhale the thing. About 20 minutes pass. I soon notice that my field of vision expands. “B, I SEE EVERYTHING,” I keep on saying. I then start talking out of my ass like I’m fucking Socrates or some shit. Regardless, I handle the first batch well. Aside from an enhanced cone of vision and the philosophizing, I don’t notice any other effects. B notices how well I’m taking the high, so he whips up another smoothie after I agree to it, this time with a stronger strain of shrooms. Also 1.5 grams. I down it within 5 minutes. Once again, I feel nothing at first. But then, after about another 30 to 45 minutes, that’s when things start to go wrong. I’m suddenly laughing my ass off at some shitty inside joke between the two of us, repeating it over and over again, being loud as fuck. The next, I’m sweating literal **GALLONS** of perspiration and my heart is fucking racing. Then, for some reason, my body forgets how to breathe, so I have to think about inhaling, then exhaling. Breathing manually is the best way that I can describe it. Then B plays some wild music, and I close my eyes and all I see is naked dudes teabagging me. It was fucking WEIRD. B then hands me some water, and, for some reason, this is what set off my extreme paranoia. I immediately get up from his couch where I was sitting, grab my phone and wallet from a nearby table, and start putting my shoes on, telling him that I was gonna go for a walk. He tells me that it wasn’t a good idea. After some thought, I reluctantly agree, deciding that it wasn’t the best idea to go outside when you’re high as fuck off of shrooms, but I’m still just as paranoid, so I go outside to a screened-in porch-like area through an adjoining sliding glass door in his apartment and just sit out there with his dog. He brings Tony into the living room with him, now extremely concerned. I chill for a bit outside and then come back inside and then tell him that I think he tried to drug me with the water and pull a Bill Cosby on me. I argue with B and Tony for a bit, still not convinced that I can trust either one of them. I then lock myself in their bathroom for about 30 minutes while I piece together the events that have unfolded in the past hour. I sort out my thoughts try to make sense of everything, and eventually come to the conclusion that I wasn’t drugged and B wasn’t tryna toss my salad. I had known him for years; if he wanted to drug and then rape someone, he would have done it long before I hung out with him. B is obviously hurt, so I apologize to him and Tony for being a cockhead, and they both go to bed while I crash on the couch, now with a killer stomach ache.

"TIFU by leading a group of American tourists who wanted to visit a portion of the Berlin Wall, but instead I took them to a completely random place in the opposite direction.",t2_7ekhwfo3,"This happened in 2015. I don’t remember the details, but here’s the gist of what happened.

I was backpacking in Europe in 2015. As I arrived to my hostel room in Berlin, I met a group of some really nice American tourists. We chatted for a bit, and since I was travelling solo, I asked to join them for some beers that night; it all went well, as far as I remember.

Next day, they wanted to visit some specific portion of the Berlin Wall (or something like that, I really don’t remember the details) and invited me to tag along (or maybe I invited myself). I had lived for 2 years in Germany back in 2007 (not in Berlin, although I had been there before), so I took the lead of the expedition; I located the place on Google Maps and told the guys to just follow me - which they did.

Worth reminding there was another Brazilian guy who was travelling by himself in our group, and he *kinda* objected to where we were going. But I wanted to impress my foreign buddies “I’m almost German, I’ve been here before, I know what I’m doing, trust me!”, so I *kinda* shut him off. Sorry, dude.

We walked for a while and got a tram for about 30 minutes (which was looking suspicious, as the place wasn’t supposed to be that far). After getting out of the tram and walking a couple of kilometers, we got to our destination – there we found…… NOTHING! Only a completely shut building. Either the place on Google Maps was misnamed, or I made some mistake (which may be more likely I guess). I have no idea…

At first, we were confused… but I realized my fuck-up almost immediately, and I’m pretty sure they did as well.

“Oh, uuh, the “place” must be this house, and it’s closed… oh well, tough luck…”, someone may have said...

Thankfully they were quite nice – or as nice as you can be – with the fact that a total stranger led them to fuck-away from every and anything remotely worth seeing in Berlin; and even though it was quite obvious I took'em to the wrong place, no one acknowledged that fact (out loud), and they all just kinda agreed that “the place was closed” - maybe because they didn’t want to embarrass me? Idk...

It was a long way back to the hostel. Later on they they’d go visit some other place, but this time I declined the invitation (if there was one… don’t remember really).

To this day, I cringe so hard when I remember this event.. The arrival, the emptiness there, everyone already tired, the obvious looks of frustration, the way back… oh, how the way back sucked.…

Anyway… sorry I made you guys lose a day in Berlin. At least the tram ride was fun…?

TL;DR volunteered to lead a group of tourists to a touristic spot, ended up taking them to the middle of fucking nowhere in Berlin.",17
TIFU by reacting like a robot to my neighbor's baby announcement,t2_7xanz,"This happened over the holidays, but I still feel embarrassed by it.  

I have vague recollection of my wife telling me a neighbor in our condo had a baby.  It wasn't someone I had met so I generally didn't pay much attention when she told me.

Flash forward to holiday week.  I was walking down the hallway and one of my neighbors, who I had never met, stepped out of his door.  I politely wished him a happy holiday.  I couldn't help but notice he had a stack of delivered boxes sitting outside his door.   As I was walking by him, I go, ""oh wow!  Looks like you got a lot of presents!""

He responded, ""Oh these are all for my daughter.  She's coming home from the hospital today.""

Now, in that moment... I couldn't calculate exactly what those words meant.  This was my first time interacting with this person.  My wife had mentioned something about a baby, but I hadn't paid attention.  I figured I had two options.

* Option 1:  Excitedly exclaim, ""Oh wow!  Congrats!  You must be so excited!""

* Option 2:  In a concerned tone say, ""Oh jeeze.  She was in the hospital?  Is everything ok??!""

Instead, I went with Option #3... which was to unemotionally say ""oh"", nod my head as a sign of understanding, and then awkwardly walk away.    

We were both wearing masks, but I could tell he was perplexed by my bizarre non-response.  He lingered in the doorway gazing at me as I sheepishly escaped into my condo.  

I immediately texted my wife for clarification and she's like, ""you dumbass I told you they had a newborn they were bringing home from the hospital!""

I'm still pretty embarrassed by it.  I've been playing it out in my head.  The neighbor probably thinks I hate babies or my ""oh"" was a sign of me being upset I'd be hearing a baby crying.   I'll probably try and save face and get a baby gift this weekend I can leave on their doorstep.

TL;DR:  Neighbor excitedly told me his newborn was finally coming home and I gave him a robotic emotionless non-reaction",17
TIFU by teaching rhymes to my 4yo.,t2_147s8x,"This happened 2 hours ago and is still on going. My daughter and I sat down for breakfast. She wanted me to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. So i did. She requested it again and again. 

I knew where this was going so i changed up the lyrics. She was taken by surprise and laughed and we started going back and fourth rhyming words. 

Long story short i ended up rhyming a word with ""fart"" and she laughed and laughed. It is the most she had laughed in a while. So I did it again to even more laughter. So she tried and we both laughed.  

Well. Now she thinks she has the ultimate key to comedy. She has been singing and ""telling jokes"" for the past two hours. 

The latest version is: ""Twinkle twinkle little zebra, how I wonder fart fart fart.""

The last joke went something like: ""Why did the elephant drive a car? Because the cat farted and it smelled like a fart.""

I told her that her joke stinks and she snorted. Her retort? ""Because a fart came out of my mouth."" To which I said ""Eww"" and laughed... which only seems to have emboldened her stand-up routine. 

TLDR: I rhymed a word with ""fart"", now the 4 year old is rhyming everything with fart and telling fart jokes.",442
"TIFU Wearing boxers instead of briefs, and probably more",t2_7xvwibgj,"**TL;DR: Had a great time with a girl, but wore boxers instead of briefs. Proceeded to obsessively think about it which may have led to her leaving and i sprained my ankle trying to fix the situation. I may have fucked up even more.**

Obligatory not a 'today I fucked up', fortunately for me, this happened last year, so I have had *plenty* of time to process it in the middle of night while pondering my existence. I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry about this situation anymore— or both— but certain mates of mine all had uncontrollable gags upon hearing my mishappening. Certainly glad my suffering was to their amusement. 

Let me give you all a rundown first:

During my uni days, I met this girl who i thought was really cute. But i'm a pretty chill guy so i never try to imply anything to anyone unless i know them for a while. We met up a couple times with her friend but never alone. Then one time i needed to give her some study material but she kept insisting that she was hungry so I suggested that we meet up for lunch. I didn't want to make her assume i thought it was a date or anything so my big brain mobilized and suggested we can have a quick bite of pizza before i head off to university to study. So we met up and the conversation was just flowing uncontrollably. We chatted about every topic off the surface of the earth. It was like opening one Pandoras box after the other and forgetting to close the doors behind, we were just completely in sync. We sat there eating pizza for 5 hours not even realizing the time passing. So far so good right? But like everything in my life so far, god just loves to play with me i guess like his little play thing he wiggles..

Anyway we drive back and she asked about my place, so I showed her around all the rooms and then showed her my room. My housemates seemed to be out of the home and it was just us now in my bedroom. Now i know what you might be thinking, smirkybois. But oh boi you be wrong bud. she just sat in the other corner with the chair while i sat in the bed. Not knowing what to make of it all and trying to not imply anything I just started having a small chat with her since she just kept sitting there not moving. She always seemed a bit naive to me about implications based on our conversations so i had no idea how to process it.

This is where the fuck up starts, I was wearing boxers, i never wear boxers its always briefs like a king. Whenever i wore boxers back then i feel like there is a hole in my pants due to its superior aerodynamics. I just could not get over this idea as it itched inside my mind. So i proceeded to just stare at my junk, menacingly trying to figure out if there was a hole. But alas no hole....But i lost track of a bit of time as i was processing the lack of hole yet airflow situation. Then I just looked up and stared at her, she just stared back and just immediately got up and started talking about how she had to go and quickly ran downstairs onto the car. I was so utterly confused in that moment i just walked after her. She said she should go and thanked me for my time and legged it.

For the next 10 minutes my mind was overclocking like Charlie from r/IASIP trying to piece together the missing puzzle pieces to Pepe Silvia. What just happened. Then it hit me, like a rock thrown against my face giving me the biggest adrenaline shock of my life. She must have insinuated something which made her uncomfy, I thought. So I just started rushing upstairs trying to get to the phone to explain myself when I tripped against the 2nd set of stair causing my ankle to jerk to the right and sprain then and there. The adrenaline was too much for it however so I kept walking up with my wobbly ankle dragging it against the carpet. I get to my room and blanked into the nothingness just thinking about it all and decided to call my friend....who honestly did little to help since they were too busy laughing about the whole situation. 


I called her 10 times to explain but she did not respond a single time which made me even more concerned. But then the weirdest message followed, she just messaged that ""she had a great time and could not message as she was driving and sorry for taking my study time"". Like what? So I called her up and in my head I had a very rational argument laid out that I was going to outline to her. As I was approaching the topic I realised nope I have no fucking idea how to say this so I looped 'so um..you know uhh' for a solid 30-50x and she just tried to move the conversation failing each time. Then she just said she had a good time and it was fun and i just ended the call there. The next few days i could not get over that whole situation and how dumb i was....Now I thought she was a bit clueless about all this interactions and meaning based on past conversations but maybe the biggest fuck up was that i had no clue what she was after that night and maybe i fucked up in more ways than i realise. Maybe I was the one that had no idea. Honestly, it was never the same after that, we met up once or twice after but i just could not get over that fuck up which meant that I would never meet her again in person even though she messaged about meeting up. She now has a partner, who is not me so :) yay go me.",8
TIFU by losing a bet,t2_g38km,"So there I was, all relaxed and listening to an old pop rock playlist with my wife and I'm not sure what got into me (no pun intended) but I wrongly bet with her that the song that we were listening to (Bowling for Soup's 1985) was actually High School Never Ends. 

The thing is...I'm the straightest man you can find off the streets. My butt clenches so tightly that I can hold a coin in between if anything foreign attempts entry. My butthole probably looks like there's a tarantula making its way out. I've not seen it before in my life. 

The item we bet was the complimentary buttplug gift that we got when we made a huge purchase at our honeymoon in New York a year ago. I knew that this was not going to end well when our dominatrix dressed cashier handed it to us with a wink. 

Anybody has any tips? Need help

TL;DR - lost a bet to use a buttplug. I'm straight. Need help",11
TIFU by taking a hot bath on day 5/6 of a 7-day fast,t2_98awjazc,"Like a lot of people in the West, I (21F) gained quite a bit of weight in quarantine. I had had an active job before and suddenly switched to a sedentary one, and I was quite averse to exercising in my house, so I put on 15-20 pounds over the course of 2020. Call it the COVID 19, if you will. It got to the point that my period was over two weeks late. There was no chance I could be pregnant (b/c virgin with no boyfriend), so this was a *massive* red flag.

So on the spur of the moment on Sunday (today is Saturday), I decided to fast for a week. Fasting for a day usually got me over delayed periods, and it worked this time too. I finally got my period on day 4 (yay!), and, surprisingly, it wasn't painful at all. 

Everything went well until day 6 (really 5.5 because I started it Sunday afternoon), when I was about to take a shower and my mom suggested I take a bath instead. I ran a hot bath and stayed in for about 20 minutes, then stood up to rinse off under a cold shower (you know, to get all the bath crud off). 

As soon as I stood up, I started feeling woozy. Standing under the cold shower improved it, but when I turned off the water, things rapidly got worse: heart racing, short of breath, ears buzzing, vision fading, swaying, the whole nine yards.

*[Narrator: That was when she knew... she screwed up.]*

 I tried to towel off but things were getting dire, so I just pulled my bathrobe halfway on, stumble-ran out of the bathroom, and flopped onto my bed. I managed to retain consciousness but lay there with my eyes shut and waited for my system to return to normal... and, of course, formulated the title for this Reddit post. After about five minutes, I was in good enough condition to get back up and retrieve the rest of my stuff from the bathroom.

So yeah... never doing that again.

TL;DR: Took a hot bath while fasting and on my period, almost passed out in the bathroom, barely made it to my bed to lie down and recover.",5
TIFU by thinking I got a girlfriend,t2_2jpva8ps,"Some backstory, I've been single for 6 years now and I'm always hoping someone will ask me or I ask someone out. I've never met a girl that I truly like to I just laid back on trying to date for a while. So today like any other I got a text saying ""wanna go out?"" so I say this is HOLIOOO do you have the right number. I gave up hope that any girl liked me. She then replies with yes I do have the right number. So you know after not interacting with a girl for a little bit I ask ""Who are you? And who gave you my phone number?"" which she then replies with ""anyone you want"". But I don't really say a thing but I bring up the question again ""Who are you?"" and she then says... ""it was a prank"" and I just felt down, didn't wanna really say anything back. She is my friend BTW not a very good one.

TL ; DR I thought I found a girl that liked me but was just a prank by a friend",26
TIFU by almost killing my cat (but stupid dog was fooled instead) and ruining a load of laundry,t2_8j0ban05,"So, today I was pretty busy multitasking, doing some work stuff, doing housework and helping my boyfriend out. Most of the housework I do on rote because I am so familiar with it, it is pretty much on autopilot. So to set the scene, in our laundry, we have two containers from Kmart that look pretty similar, one for cat food and one for laundry powder. I needed to do a load of laundry and also feed the cat at the same time, I’m pretty sure you can see where this is headed. 
Yep, I did it, I put the cat food in the laundry powder slot, slammed it shut and put it on the required setting, didn’t even think twice. 
Then I put a scoop of laundry powder in the cat food bowl, which is also in the laundry and then mentally ticked the boxes in my head, job complete. I vaguely remember the cat sauntering past the cat food bowl, with the dog looking with hope for cat food treats a couple of metres away. The washing machine cycle, thank god, only lasts for 45 mins, and when it is complete it sings a tune like it is singing an opera for about 15 minutes, which means it gets emptied pretty quickly. So, I go to get the washing out of the machine, and it is covered in brown goop. I’m scratching my head trying to figure it out, when my dog, runs past the door, with foam coming out of her mouth. I grab her and freak out and let my vet know that I am coming in with an emergency case. I get there, they ask me a few questions, but the main one is, has she consumed any surfactants? I have no idea, until I’ve thought through my day, and realise that they mean laundry powder. 

End of the story is all the clothes I’ve washed with the cat food have to be thrown out, asshole cat has walked away from the washing powder in her food bowl and has let the dog eat it, like the big dog idiot that she is. The dog was completely fine, but it’s lucky that she is a pretty lady, because she is not that bright. The cat is still currently acting like a smug bastard and the washing machine isn’t worse for wear.

TL;DR fed pets laundry powder and put cat food in the washing machine. Laundry ruined and dog ends up at the vet. All is fine in the end.",10
TIFU by using a hairdryer to clear my swimmer’s ear,t2_paqirdc,"5 years ago, while on my honeymoon, my wife and I went on a snorkeling/booze cruise and I managed to get a fair amount of water in my ear. (half drunk on rum and snorkeling…go figure) In my drunken stupor I alternated between using a hairdryer and cue tips to attempt to relieve the pressure but eventually gave up and went to bed.  The next day the pressure was not nearly as bad, but a faint case of tinnitus came in its place. Assuming that I did some sort of slight permanent damage and not wanting to ruin the rest of the honeymoon, I tried to put it behind me and continued on my way.  
Fast-forward to last week, the tinnitus never went away, and I have avoided getting my ears wet at all due to them clogging at the slightest sign of pressure.  One afternoon, I was scrolling aimlessly on my phone and received a targeted ad for some ear canal camera/ear cleaner device and figured… sure why not. The camera showed up yesterday and my mind was blown to see the solid wall of yellow/ green earwax staring right back at me. 
Shocked, confused, and pretty grossed out, I was able to get an appointment at the Drs office for this morning and after the nurse soaking my ear canal in hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes and pressure washed with warm water, she was met with a tsunami of rust colored ear wax.
Five years later, I have no sign of the tinnitus, and can finally hear clearly from my left ear.  

Tldr: I’m a dope and melted earwax to my eardrum …then waited five years to have it looked at.",106
Tifu by throwing out her toothbrush for the second time,t2_6gnjov2b,"TL;DR Been dating a girl on the regular, she stays over at my place with increased frequency,  I end up offending her by throwing her eclectic toothbrush away. I did it because of my past experience of moving too quickly into a relationship and moving in prematurely tends to be a relationship killer.  

Met this girl on Tinder in December and we hit it off instantly, she gets my pseudo intellectual ramblings about nothing, I enjoy her quick wit and attempts at being funny. We spent our first date driving to the country side, hanging out in nature, getting lost in conversation. Dating during the pandemic blues doesn’t leave much to do, I picked her up in my car and suggest that we spend our second date making a food painting of this album cover that we both liked. She was delighted, smitten even. We went off to the supermarket got our ingredients and head on back to my place. 

There we were designing the canvas, using a medley of fruits and melted chocolate as our paint. With our creative juices flowing, our bodies moving purposefully in close proximity with increasing intimacy, things got heated and passion envelops. 

The third and forth date flowed together and the notion of dates became redundant. She spent the rest of the weekend at my place. On Monday morning she went back to her place, an apartment shared between her and two friends. She told me she would be working at home the entire week, and so was I. 

I went in the toilet to freshen myself up for the day, and my eyes fixed its gaze on a new toothbrush nestled in a cup next to mine, my carefully rolled up toothpaste squeezed in the middle. A sense of dread came over me, crawling up my spine sending shivers down my body, I could hear the accelerated thumping of my heartbeat, as if struck by vertigo, sending me into a head spin, I had to sit down on the toilet seat, regulate my breathing to slowly gain back some composure. 

It was one of the Beast’s milder incarnation. 

I went through a rather amicable divorce last year, my ex wife and I remained friends. During one of our save the marriage discussions, I realized that I too often suffer from “passion overdrafts”. For pretty much every relationship I have had, we fall head over heels and things always progressed too quickly, before I realsied it I am already in a live In relationship. This pattern repeated itself too many times, and passion quickly fades into care and responsibility. The sudden appearance of a toothbrush with its own unique placeholder came to represent the beginning of the end for romance and passion. 

I threw the fucker away without second thought. I went to the store stocked up on some cheaper more disposable options. I mean dental health matters too despite my irrational fears. She didn’t notice anything about the toothbrush and she continued to sleep over 2-3 times a week.

We spent Christmas and New Years apart as she made plans to visit her parents back home. 
She came back on the eve of New Year’s Day, I must admit that I missed her over the holidays and couldn’t wait to see her again. As soon as our eyes met, we ran and greeted each other in a loving embrace, mask to mask. 

The night after, I had a few friends over for game night, we had lots of fun and my friends even dropped the you guys make a cute couple remark. Which we happily acknowledged. The night of inebriation and kush smoke rolled on till early dawn. I didn’t take to functioning with any awareness until late Sunday afternoon, and I saw an electric toothbrush next the basin. It left an impression on my mind but my hungover state debilitated me from taking any meangful action.

When Monday came round again, the eclectic toothbrush was still there, this time nestled in my Homer Simpson mug which belonged only to the kitchen. I didn’t quite get a panic attack this time, but I Instinctly threw it in the bin. We both had a busy week and I didn’t see her until Thursday night, I fell asleep quite early as I had a lot to deal with this week. 

So she left on Friday morning and I didn’t hear from her until today. I got a text from her this morning, asking why I threw her toothbrush away and that if I didn’t want her around I should just say so. At first I thought I would just play it off as an accident of sorts, soon realizing that she is no fool and that such a disingenuous answer may just dig me into a deeper hole. I told her it’s something we should talk about and although it seems counterintuitive but I did it because I do care about this thing that we are having.

I know its pretty indisputable that the asshole is me in this case, but do you think I can make things right? I will be meeting her tomorrow, despite the cold, she chose a coffee shop with outdoor seatings. I plan to tell her about my whole panic attack issue and why I threw out her toothbrush.  Yikes  😬",2
Tifu by sending my Cub Scouts on an adventure of inappropriateness,t2_17g1w9,"Welp!  Cub Scouts during Covid has been difficult as it is.  No indoor meetings allowed, and the weeknights are dark and it’s winter.  So today I thought, let’s go animal themed, going over identification first.   I found a website for the Zoom meeting that was a random animal generator.  Just hit the button and a new animal pops up.  Scrolled the screen so they couldn’t see the name below the picture.  Was all set up and tested.  The screen showed a nice blue whale.  First press on random got the kids a bird.  I heard “bird,” “seagull,” even “stork.”   I didn’t know this sea bird so I scrolled down to read it.  I stared for a second.  Just skipped to the next one.  Then it started.   One kid yelled out “Booby!”  Then another.  Then the giggling.  A group of 7 year olds just having their time.  Saw a parent in one screen just shake his head.  I tried to recollect them.  A few animals later was a turkey.  And again.  “Now there are two boobies!”  “Look at mine” as one boy lifted his shirt.  It took a bit to regain control.  Tried so hard to do something entertaining.  I guess on that end I succeeded.  

TL:DR  set up a random animal generator for a Cub Scout Zoom meeting, and the first animal that came up was a booby.  All the 2nd graders went crazy.",40
"TIFU: Getting COVID, eating chicken and passing gas",t2_7nbbiz67,"So this was months ago but based on the title you may know what happened first. I got COVID. As you may know, when you get covid you have the potential to not taste or smell anything. Well thats exactly happened to me. 

While I was home in quarantine, I was making some lunch for myself using a roast chicken in the fridge. Not knowing how long the chicken was in there and fearing the worst I smelled it... nothing finding that strange I smelled it again still nothing... so the only logical thing to do was eat it. So I did... all week... and because I also couldnt taste well it tasted fine! 

However, all week I steam pressed my Calvin's like nooooo other! My girlfriend was also in quarantine with me nearly suffocated on night after coming to bed with me after I had been sleeping for an hour. Now passing gas isnt pleasant to smell anyway but after a eating an entire questionable (at best) roast chicken... they are nuclear. Lucky for me I couldn't smell it :)


TL;DR Moral of the story is kids, don't get COVID and eat chicken it may end poorly!",5
TIFU by by going through my boyfriends things and finding a vail of 'sand'.,t2_9obt2vdn,"Okay so disclaimer, this happened while I was dating my now husband about 6 years ago. I still laugh at this story in hindsight and wanted to share it with you.

So my BF and I had been dating for about a month, and he decided to invited me over to his house for dinner. I was pretty excited to be able to see where he lived and enjoy a nice night of pizza and Netflix. It was a pretty great night, we had great chemistry and the pizza was good. We hung out in his room to watch Netflix because that was where he kept his largest TV and Playstation. We snuggled for a while and he excused himself to go to the bathroom. 

'Perfect,' I thought, 'now I can snoop for a bit!' I didn't want to violate his privacy too much but I was super curious and wanted to look at all the things he had out and about on his dresser and shelves(fair game right?). He had lots to look at: books, collectibles, photos, and diffrent kinds of nick-nacks. As I was going through the shelves I found two containers of white sand. One was a large glass, round jar and the other was a small vial(like what you would hang on a necklace). Both containers where sealed with rubber stoppers. My first thought were that these were souvenirs from trips. I myself owned a jar of sand and shells from Florida from a family vacation. I picked up and examined the larger and put it down. No shells in it at all. I then picked up the smaller vail and started rotating it to see if there was anything in the sand. Nope, nothing. 

Turns out the stopper was not as secure on the small one. Much to my horror, the stopper fell out and the sand went down my front and all over the floor. I stood there trying to decide what to do, there was no way to put the sand back, maybe I could just hide it? 

Nope! He returned to the room at that moment. I turned around, deer in the headlights, 'I'm sorry, I spilt this thing of sand.'

'Uuhhhmmmm, that wasn't sand. That was full of my dead fiancé ashes.'

So there I was. Not only caught in the act of snooping the moment he left the room, but I was also coated in a fine layer of his dead fiancé. I immediately start tearing up and shaking. 'Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Oh my God! What do I dooooo?!' I stood stock still, my first thought was to try to brush HIS DEAD FIANCÉ off my hands/shirt, but that would be disrespectful right? I mean I can't just shake her off of me and on to the floor. OMG, I SPILT HER ON THE CARPET, WHAT DO WE DO!? SHE IS EVERYWHERE. HE IS GOING TO BE SO PISSED! AM I NOW GOING TO BE HAUNTED BY THE ANGRY GHOST OF HIS DEAD FIANCÉ?

He was surprisingly calm for what was going on and  quickly brushed me off. He then walked me out side to dust my hands into the garden, and then went to go get the vacuum. All the while I'm blubbering like a baby, dying from embarrassment, and waiting to be scolded for spilling his dead fiancé all over myself. He took me back inside and sat me down to calm down. I must have sat there and cried for a good 5 minutes while he patted my back and tried to comfort me. He was very kind and understanding, but I was still so mortified. Not only did I spill the vail, but I was also having a panic attack about it. But in my defense, its not everyday you accidentally spill a dead person on yourself. But like he should be the upset one, not me right? 

I calmed down, and he explained that it was okay. He actually owned half of her ashes and they where safety out of MY reach and in the top of the closet. The vail was a memento from the ceremony. I was quite lucky I didn't spill the larger one, because that one was his dead best friend and all he had. 

Moral of the story, dont snoop! And if you keep dead people in your house, please properly label them to avoid confusion. 

TL;DR While snooping through my BFs stuff I found and spilt a small vail of 'beach sand'. Plot twist! It wasn't sand, but the cremated remains of his dead fiancé.",23
"TIFU by fcking up x00000 times in my life, every time I have interacted with my gran",t2_50dlha13,"So, a bit of background: I am completely accent deaf. I have such an inability to tell accents apart, people think I'm trolling them. For non-uk people this may not make too much sense, but I used to work in a phone job where I regularly spoke to people from Birmingham and Wales, and I could not tell the accents apart, they always assumed i would know who I was speaking to because of the accents but nope, not even the slightest clue. I can't hear the difference between American and English. Sometimes I can tell if I hear them together, but I can only really tell they're different not which is which.

So today, my husband and I were talking about my (scottish) grandmother, the conversation then moved to him saying something along the lines of
""Have you ever noticed how older people don't lose the accents of their birthplace as much as younger people seem to?"" I looked at him confused, we were just talking about my gran who sounds as English as I do ""but my gran doesn't sound Scottish anymore"" and he just.. gave me this look.. and then burst out laughing ""you can tell she is Scottish by the first syllable of her speaking"". 

I am almost 28. I have heard my gran speak for 28 years and always just thought she'd lost her accent because she's lived in England so long. If I didnt know she was Scottish, I never would have known because, to me, she had so little of an accent. 

But turns out she is very very Scottish and my accent deafness is even worse than I thought. 

Now when people talk on TV, my husband keeps telling me everyone is Scottish and I genuinely don't know when he is joking or not 😂

Its hilarious, really, that I am so accent deaf when my husband is a voice actor. Well...hilarious for me. Endlessly unhelpful for him hahaha.

Take that, Alanis - THAT'S irony.

TL;DR TIFU by not realising my gran had a strong Scottish accent for 28 years",5
TIFU by asking for TP in a gas station bathroom.,t2_8069vu31,"I still can’t believe I was such an idiot. Obligatory this is on mobile so apologies for formatting. 

Backstory: My boyfriend is moving so we’re road-tripping to his new apartment today. When you gotta go you gotta go, so we exit and and stop at this random gas station. 

I rush inside because of course I waited too long before informing my bf that I was in need of a tinkle. I open the door to the bathroom and immediately smash it into this poor child who was standing right in front of the door. Oof. Not a good way to start out my bathroom break. I should have known worse things were coming. 

Another child is in the first stall (I can tell by their tiny feet under the door) so after apologizing profusely to the mother of the child I schmacked, I rush to the open stall. Sweet relief. I’ve been eating junk food all day, so I also take a respectable dump after my tinkle. THEN. HORROR.

THERE’S NO TOILET PAPER IN THE DISPENSER. 

I can’t believe I was in such a rush that I didn’t check to make sure there was toilet paper. I sit on the toilet for an indeterminate amount of time considering my options. Unfortunately, the TP rolls offered in this bathroom are the big industrial kind so the cardboard is way too solid to be torn up and used as a last resort wipe. I took a junk food dump so it’s not like I have the option to pull up my pants and live through a little dampness.

Option number three: A mom and her kid walked into the bathroom so maybe I can ask them to toss me some paper towels? Thankfully this was a different mom and child from the one I door smashed when I first walked into the bathroom. (Usually option number three would be asking the person in the stall next to you for TP but since it was a little kid I decided to negotiate with the adult in the room.) 

I close my eyes and wish myself luck and hope that I don’t die of embarrassment in the next few moments... “Excuse me, ma’am, there’s no toilet paper in here. Can you pass me some paper towels? I’m in the last stall!” 

The lady says back “I’m so sorry, there’s no paper towels out here.” AND THEN, the probably around 8 year old girl in the first stall says “There’s no toilet paper in here either!” Because this random mom is a queen she assures us that she’ll go talk to the person at the counter. The employee comes in, throws a roll to the girl in the first stall and throws a roll to me. 

VICTORY! I get to wipe! YAY! I finish my business, turn around to put the TP roll on the back of the toilet... and my heart stops. I ask the good Lord why he let somebody as idiotic and imbecilic as me to be born, and I lay the roll of TP that the gas station employee got me... on top of the full extra roll of TP that had been in the stall since the beginning of this ENTIRE ordeal. 

I leave my bathroom stall with shame in my heart and apologize to the employee and the mom who got the employee. I wash my hands as fast as I can, run STRAIGHT to the car without buying anything like I originally planned to, and decided that I really FU today so reddit deserves to have an indelible record of my shame...

TL;DR: Went to the bathroom, realized there was no TP in my stall, mustered the courage to ask for somebody to get something to wipe my bum with. There’s absolutely NOTHING in this bathroom for bum wiping so an employee is summoned to bring extra TP. After receiving the extra roll, come to the horrifying realization that there had been a roll of TP behind me the entire time.",5
TIFU by getting the COVID vaccine,t2_9q6lq7ra,"Throwaway because job details and embarrassing story. Obligatory this happened on Monday, but my coworker just gave me the idea to tell you people about this embarrassing incident. 

I work in a hospital and was excited to find out that it was my turn to get the first vaccine dose. But the night before, I received some family news that really threw me for a loop and I was emotionally devastated. The next morning, I was sleep deprived and still really shaken up, but I was determined to get that shot ASAP. This was a mistake. I have this thing called vasovagal syncope, which is when a trigger, usually intense emotions, needles, the sight of blood, etc., causes a rapid drop in blood pressure and leads to tunnel vision, cold sweats, nausea, and even loss of consciousness for a few seconds. It is not dangerous, and people are generally completely fine afterward. This has only popped up once or twice in my entire life (I passed out when getting my nose pierced, but that's about it lol). I am not afraid of needles at all. I work with needles and blood all the time; it is literally my job. But I guess the emotional exhaustion from the night before and the anticipation of getting the vaccine was too much. As soon as the needle went in, my vision darkened and I instantly felt light-headed. I recognized what was happening and knew that the episode would only last a few seconds if I lost consciousness, but I did not have enough time to tell the nurse this. So this room full of healthcare workers just sees this lady (me) get the covid vaccine and seconds later slump over in her chair. Of course, they're worried that I'm one of those poor bastards that's having an adverse reaction to the vaccine itself, and they spring into action. There's already a stretcher being wheeled in my direction a group of people surrounding me when I come to, and I groggily explain to everyone that no, I'm fine, I just need to chill out for a bit. The nurses, bless them, took amazing care of me anyway. They brought me snacks and water and would not let me leave until I felt 100% normal. This was all super embarrassing as not only were these people technically my coworkers, but I was also wearing an ID badge for a job position that should definitely not be held by someone that passes out in the presence of needles. I kept saying that this never happens and that I'm totally fine with needles, but I could tell they were skeptical. I will probably be an entertaining story told in break rooms for weeks to come.

TL;DR: My body decided that getting the covid vaccine would be an appropriate time to lose consciousness, healthcare workers freak out. 

But who cares, I got the vaccine, and I am so grateful that I got to get it as early as I did! Now both me and my patients are safer. When you get the opportunity, PLEASE get vaccinated. It is safe, effective, and *probably* won't make you pass out ;) ",81

TIFU by having the confidence of an extremely average white man,t2_15hkxv," 

Last week, I wanted to print something at home. That's when it became apparent that my printer ran out of colored ink. Me, being a cheap ass eastern european, was not about to waltz down to the local store to buy new cartridges that at this point are more expensive than my whole damn printer, so I ordered printer ink from Amazon. Refilling a printer cartridge is not rocket science after all, right?

My order arrived today and on with it I went. I pull out the cartridge, got a syringe, squirted some ink into the cartridge and back in the printer it went. To nobody's shock but my own, the printer still wouldn't print. What is one to do in a situation like this but turn it off and on again? After that failed, I started googling the error message I was getting. ""What to do when \*insert printer make and model\* gives error 5200?"" As more time passed and more obscure the message boards I was visiting, the more esoteric the solutions became. 3 hours later, 15 restarts in, after sacrificing 2 goats and promising Cthulhu he can have my first born, the printer was still not printing.

As I was contemplating whether human sacrifice could aid me in my quest of obtaining a picture of a non-monochrome cat, my husband suggested maybe the old ink inside the cartridge dried up, and the dried flakes keep getting stuck inside the slit the ink is supposed to come out of, which explains why the printer won't print in color but it occasionally leaks colored ink.

I was ready to try anything and frankly, emptying and washing out the entire cartridge was slightly less extreme than human sacrifice so I decided to give it a try. I pulled the cartridge out, took it to the bathroom sink, filled up my 10 ml syringe with water, put it into the yellow ink holding part of the cartridge, pushed the plunger and nothing happened. Nothing happened? Nothing happened!

That's when it dawned on me that I fucked up so spectacularly a doctor might need to check me over. You know, to make sure I'm not currently suffering from some sort of brain damage I was unaware of. The printer, dear reader, wasn't printing because I added, give or take, 3 ml of ink. 3 instead of the roughly 17 it takes to fill up the cartridge... which is why nothing happened when I emptied the water into the cartridge rather than in overflowing as I was expecting.

I spent half a day trying to fix, to no avail, a non-existent problem because I failed to consider, that perhaps, that thing I never did before... I did wrong. Not for a second did I stop and think to myself: ""Maybe the reason this printer that was out of color ink, isn't printing in color, because I, the person who refilled the cartridge, refiled it wrong.""

Today, if nothing else, will serve as evidence to all my future therapists that while I might be a basket case with innumerable issues, nobody can ever accuse me of lacking self-confidence ever again. In fact, it is now plainly obvious that I have the same amount of unearned and unwarranted self-confidence that most of my male peers are just naturally blessed with.

TL;DR  I didn't put enough ink into the printer cartridge and went on to waste half a day unable to figure out why the printer won't print, simply because I failed to consider I could have fucked up refilling the printer cartridge.",90
"TIFU By watching porn in the shower and having it fall behind the shower panel playing full volume, while my friends and girlfriend are directly below me.",t2_9q8ru9l6,"Obligatory throw away account due to friends/girlfriend know my username.

So I'm up at my friend's house in Vermont, old ski house, 120 years old. We've all been hanging out all week so after a full day of skiing I decided to treat myself to a nice long shower. 

(Bathroom is the only one in the house, we're all drinking beers. The shower is a very basic and is basically a metal box with a shower head)

I start watching some porn because my buddies are playing some tunes and my girlfriend is busy working. I'm feeling frisky so why the hell not. Meow. So anyways I get to showering and some self care when I go to adjust where in the ""film"" I'm at. I push the screen to move the bar then my phone just falls down a dark crevice where there's a slit just wider than my phone. Fuckkk. 

Naturally, instead of getting right to finding my phone, I sort myself out so I can focus. This fucking movie is a full feature length film and it's moving past the quieter blowjob part. I try pulling the shower out but it's glued to the floor. Then I get clothed to run to my car, past everyone, trying to keep it cool and grab a flat head to pull the panel of the shower out. No one any wiser I run back upstairs and find the fucking panel is so rusted to the other panels it's essentially glued in place. Again, fuck.  

There was a little attic space that was unfinished abutting the bathroom and directly behind the shower. I notice it's particle board over the top of sheet rock. I do as any self respecting man who's phone is blasting some girl getting railed by some rather gifted men and I start digging. I'm like Andy in Shawshank Redemption, careful not to make any noise when in between lulls in songs.

Light at the end of the tunnel! Holy fucking shit! I'm sweating while ripping away dry wall, careful not to make too much noise. After ripping away about half what I needed to take out my girlfriend knocks on the door... ""Honey, is everything okay? it seems like you've been in here a while?"" She asked while there is some muffled moaning that to me sounds super loud. ""Errr yes, I think the chili is just getting to me, nasty stuff going on in here"" She walks back downstairs and I get back to pulling off particle board/drywall. 

Finally! About 15 old razor blades and soap bars fall down and just behind it my phone! Thank Jesus! I walk back downstairs feeling like a champ and grab some freshly made curry. 

Tl;dr I go to have some self care after a long day of skiing and drop my phone in the trench behind an old shower. Have to dig through drywall and particle board in order to get at it while I'm above my friends and girlfriend.",34
TIFU by watching interrogation of a murderer on youtube,t2_8g0jouyg,"I'm not usually phased by crime that much, but this one really caught me off guard. This 2 hour interrogation video was recommended to me on youtube, and I watched all of it. I've never heard of this case before cause I was quite young when this incident took place, so I spiralled down into the rabbit hole.

I'm talking about the case of Travis Alexander. I read the whole wiki page, saw pictures, checked their myspace accounts, read comments, journals and found out how creepy this whole thing was.

The guy was literally commenting on her myspace pics and then he got murdered by her. This whole case really disturbed me, cause it almost feels cinematic, but it's not! This is real life we're talking about. I ended up feeling pretty bad about both of them.

It has triggered some panic/anxiety centres of my brain cause I've dealt with weird exes. Now I'm scared, creeped out and having a panic attack. 

Tl;dr- watched a murder interrogation and now I'm feeling anxious",0
TIFU by drinking $600 worth of booze.,t2_ico5q,"I lost my Uncle this past fall. He was the odd duck of the family and I loved him very much, we had lots in common. He introduced me to many of the things I love to do.

He was a high paid Lawyer and was terrible with money. The rest of my family is poor, so I grew up hearing tales of his monetary misdeeds. For example, he used his bonus one year to buy a condo in Key West only to lose it because he didn't pay his taxes. He was so bad at adulting he never had a phone line for long because he'd forget to pay the bill, so his company gave him a cell phone that they paid for (unheard of at that time) The company he worked for loved him for his work. There are many other stories, but on to the TIFU.

I asked by my Mother if I wanted any of his books from his summer bungalow (not as grand as it sounds, more of a higher-end trailer park. you own the house, but pay a lot fee and get to have a beach house with on Long Island but not pay 1m plus for it) I could not let books go to the dumps so I went with her with a ton of bags and filled my truck. She told me to take anything I wanted or else it will go in the dumpster so the place can be empty when they sell it. Most of the non-book related stuff was junk. I found some great pictures that I kept and a few other odds and ends.

One of those odds and ends is the heart of the TIFU. It was a smallish red box with a brass plaque. It has a small bottle of booze inside. I should have known it was not a normal bottle of booze because it was in a glass case with some other beach themed bricka brack. So fast forward last night, I pull out the box and after a hard day, I think I'd give it a try. I'm not much of a drinker, I'll have a glass of scotch every few months but that is about it. No beer or wine unless I use it for cooking. My lack of experience with alcohol comes in to play here.

I sit down get out two glasses (one for the wife, it's good to share) crack open the case, and pour us each a little taste. That first sip was when I knew I had fucked up. It was way too smooth, like zero burn at all. I finished my glass and but the supplies glass (spoiler, it's not glass) stopper in the top to save the rest for later.

As I'm sitting there letting the warmth radiate out from my belly, I grab my phone to see if I can find more of this excellent booze. I think I've just added one more thing that I can accredit my Uncle for turning me onto. I just drank a $600 dollar Louis XIII Cognac. I start freaking out. I frantically search hoping to find out that please god let this not be what came up on the search. Yeah nope. Even the empty crystal bottle and case sells for over $100 bux on ebay. There are so many things that I would rather spend $600 on than a drink. I even had a nightmare about it last night.

And that's how things went when you were my Uncle. A $600 bottle of booze hidden among the junk. Thanks for one last wild ride Uncle.

TL;DR drank what I thought was cheap booze, which turned out to be the most expensive drink of my life.",23641
TIFU by breaking the rules of a secret society the moment I was invited,t2_8wgrq6xt,"So I go to an Ivy, and my school has secret societies. It’s pretty hard to get an invite, and usually you have to be “in the know” to get one, but somehow, I got one.
Now some background here, on two levels: A) I am not a rich kid. In fact, I am a full scholarship kid. And B) I have had a very bad couple of days including being very sick and on meds. 
 But so, I got invited to join a secret society — only to break their rules by responding to the request from the wrong email. I hadn’t fully read the email before and I immediately sent a follow up, but now I’m so anxious that I’ll get booted because of this. I feel so stupid and I’m sick and on drugs so I wasn’t really thinking straight, but I’m so anxious now about not being let in, which is so dumb because it’s just a dumb rich kids club that I shouldn’t even be excited for. It’s not even a super big deal, and I’m already in a frat that I love so dearly and love all my frat sibs, so this shouldn’t matter to me, but for some dumb reason it does. Anyone else ever feel like that? Like you probably shouldn’t care but still do?? I hate the feeling. 

Oh well. I’m just being stupid, thought I’d feel better if I shared my dumbassery 😂

TL:DR - i was invited to join a secret society at school but immediately sent my response from my school email, which may prevent me from joining said secret society. Will update on whether I get a response soon",8
TIFU by not locking the bathroom door,t2_5891x1k9,"This happened about 2 hours ago. 

So my family and I are going on a holiday, coz that’s a thing you can still do in upside down land. It’s the morning before and I thought I’d go for a shower so I’m nice and clean. So I went into the bathroom with all my stuff and forgot to lock the door... I’ve done this more times then I care to admit. Anyway I thought I might go for a wank, coz that’s the horny fuck I am. So I got some porn ready and as I started to get into it, my sister walked in, as she didn’t know I was in there. She look directly at me... then she looked down, then walked out. You could say that this was a r/WatchPeopleDieInside moment for the both of us, coz I definitely died. I can’t get mad at her coz I didn’t lock the door, but still. I’m kind of avoiding her now and I’m grateful that we’re taking 2 cars.

TIFU by brushing my teeth,t2_8udqhtbt,"My morning routine always starts with me going to the toilet, brushing teeth etc.  
Today was no any different, getting the toothpaste on the brush and getting it over with.  
After 1-2 minutes a bitter taste unfolds in my mouth and I'm thinking ""Mhhh, must be a weird morning taste, that happens every now and then"" and I'm not fully awake yet, so I will just ignore it.  
Getting right back to it and being more vigorous than before, to get the longing taste out of my mouth.

Turns out: the taste was still there and stronger than ever. I finally take a look at my toothbrush and see a small bug stuck in it, which I basically just spread in my whole mouth. Being super disgusted and shaky I immediately grabbed the mouthwash, gargling the disgusting taste away.

I tried get the mouthwash as far as possible to the back of my throat as well.  
By pulling my head back and gurgling, I started choking on it and swallowed a whole gulp of it.

  
Apparently I don't handle bug taste and mouthwash together and started projectiling vomit.

TL;DR: brushed teeth while a bug was stuck in it, using mouthwash after it, choking and ended up puking",323
TIFU by letting maggots flood my studio,t2_9ql722er,"This actually happened earlier today...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm enjoying my morning coffee and smoke after waking up, looking forward to a day of doing nothing at all, the sun is beautiful through my window. I go to the kitchen (i live in a very small studio, but it's divided into kitchen, office and bedroom) and on my way back see this little white maggot crawling on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

Disgusting enough, right? I try to understand what I'm seeing with my slow-still-not-caffeinated-enough brain when i look over to my window and on the floor beneath it there are HUNDREDS OF THOSES CREEP CRAWLING WHITE MOTHERFUCKERS. I really mean hundreds, by the way.

&amp;#x200B;

I panic for a few seconds, because that's a scene from a nightmare to me, and don't have a fucking clue where they are coming from, what are they, if they are dangerous at all... So I do what any reasonable and methodic person would to in this situation and start to pound the shit out of those maggots with my flip flops.

&amp;#x200B;

Now... Just a clarification, my house is actually pretty clean, i keep it tidy, but saturday is usually the dirtiest day since I don't really have much time or energy to do much in that regard in the weekdays. It's definitively not the kind of home you'd expect to find maggots in. That will be important in a few lines.

&amp;#x200B;

So I beat the shit of of those MF for maybe half and hour, and they keep coming. They are heavily concentrated under my window, but some isolated ones are everywhere. BUT. THEY. KEEP. COMING! So the coffee kicks in and I start to be smart, and look for the source of those fuckers.

&amp;#x200B;

I look into the cat litter... Nothing. I look into the food bowl. Nothing. I look into the bathroom. Not a single one there. I open the trash can in the kitchen... BINGO!! There they are! So, again like a very moderate and methodic person, I wrap the whole can in a bag and throw that shit away. If I could I would burn it.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting rid of the source, their numbers dwindled. My final blow was looking into my cleaning products for the strongest thing there, found a glowing greeen desinfectant (not an overstatement, that shit cannot be safe to use) and mopped the floor franticaly with that in the hopes of killing every single living thing on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, with a calmer mind, I looked them up and they are actually house fly maggots, and they are not dangerous. I cleaned every inch of my studio and thing seem to be spotless now, but i still ocasionally take a lap around the house to look for them.

&amp;#x200B;

My mistake was simply not taking out the trash. I usually just take out the trash whan the can is full, but for some reason I spent this week without filling the can, so I didn't bother. And oh my, I really regret it. That's all folks, remember that when your mother told you to take the trash every day, she was right.

TL;DR - Woke up to a house full of maggots because I forgot to take out the trash for a week.",2
TIFU by saying my 3-mile time as 3 km time.,t2_yhvl3,"This did not exactly happen today but has been happening over the past few weeks.  

Now, I live in a country where we use the metric system exclusively and during this corona/WFH time I say, you know let's join the gym and lose all the chub I've gained so far. I may not be the world's fastest runner but I'd say I'm pretty fit, I was a regular Sunday league player and used to play racquet sports often.  

This is where I fucked up royally, I used to keep my 3-mile time a bit hush-hush about 25 mins and one day at the treadmill I hit a 22 min my all-time best. I then proceed to take a photo and gloat it to all my friends and family saying that I ran ""3 km"" (not miles) in 22 mins.  

This is where my slander begins, I was getting wrecked left, right and centre. Heck, even my 60-year-old dad said that his walking is faster than my ""3km"" timing. My friends were sending me screenshots of them running 5 km in 24 mins. And I was shocked, at the very least to see those timings. There was no chance in hell that these donnies (who are as fit as me, if not less) are running almost twice the distance in almost half the time. And checking 5 km timings online did not help either, I was seeing the average timing for my age is about 20 min and seeing the women's timings made me even more depressed. And this went on for weeks until I overheard the gym trainer instructing a new member to run 2 ""MILES."" And then it hit me, the treadmill displayed the distance in miles and not in km. I then tried my best to explain to everyone about the misunderstanding. Now, whether they believe it or not it's up to them. I can't be bothered anymore.

TL;DR: Mistook my 3-mile run time as 3 km run time and now I look like a fool.",7
TIFU by letting my boyfriend kiss me,t2_3xekkut2,"Have to apologise first, I'm writing this on mobile.

Some hours ago my boyfriend and I were messing around having fun. We were kissing and teasingly pulling each other's tongues until I suddenly felt something tear. I wasn't sure what it was until I felt pain in my mouth and tasted blood. My boyfriend didn't know what had happened so he just sat there while I stood up heading to the kitchen to get a glass of water. 

What's important to know is that I cannot see, taste or even smell my own blood. No idea why cause I've got no problem with helping other people when they are hurt. 

So while I'm in the kitchen I notice my vision starting to blur a bit. I know this stupid reaction my body has, so I walk to the living room and drop on the couch before it gets worse. The blurry vision doesn't seem to want to go away so I stay on the couch. Meanwhile my boyfriend has come to the couch and is asking me how he can help. I tell him to get a glass of water but, oh no, that was a big mistake. It just made the taste of blood explode in my mouth, making it even harder for me to stay calm. 

While I'm still sitting on the couch my dad comes back from grocery shopping. He doesn't notice anything wrong until he sees me and says ""you're extremely bleak, what's wrong?"". Me and my boyfriend try to explain, or more like my boyfriend on his own because my vision is getting even worse. My dad tells me to go to the bathroom and hold my wrist under the cold water. Normally, that does the trick. But this time my vision doesn't want to get better and now my ears are also starting to give up. I only hear my boyfriend and dad as if they are far far away. My dad is yelling at me about what's wrong and that it can't be that bad, but I don't really hear him. I walk back to the living room. But that was a bad idea. My legs start wobbling and I don't really notice anything around me. I can't walk straight anymore. 

If it wasn't for my dad, who had gone back to the living room before me, I would've crashed to the ground, unconscious, and probably hit my head hard enough to get a concussion. Or maybe even worse, I could've hit the side of the table. 
But luckily my dad caught me and placed me on the couch, legs up, shock position. Instantly my vision came back, my hearing improved and 
I was aware of my surroundings again. I stayed there, laying on the couch for about half an hour, my boyfriend behind me caressing my head, still concerned. It turns out I tore the frenulum of my tongue. Not as bad as it may sound - my frenulum is too short so maybe this even improved the length of my frenulum. I'll see that in some weeks.

So what I can say: if you are one of those people like me who doesn't cope well with his or her own blood, don't forget your ways of trying to convince your body that nothing's going on. It can be life saving. If I would've hit my head it could have had severe aftermath.

TIFU by trying to clean my laptop,t2_8zk9g7fi,"Just to begin I know very little about computers (before anyone asks 22M. For a lot of people a majority of our entertainment comes from these shiny little arrays of pixels. In an attempt to make my 4yo laptop run better I had the bright idea to take it apart and clean it (the start of today's fuck up).

Watching someone that knows much more about computers, I did as they did and pulled out screws, unplugged cables (actually just yanked my cpu cord out from its plug without opening the clasp then realized it shouldn't have required as much force on the next ones) then made my way to the fan/heatsink and sprayed out 4 years of dust.

I managed not to lose any screws and put everything back in just as it was, or so I thought. Upon starting I got an error that there was no hard drive detected, I do a quick Google and then start dicking around my bios section to get a proper boot.

~2 hours and 37 tears later I'd given up on my sole source of entertainment. A bowl of green later I decided ""it's not gonna work I may as well try taking the hard drive out and putting it back again"" (forgot to put this in when I posted) then it booted up just fine. TIL that if it's not broke don't fix it at least with computers.

TIFU by making eggs,t2_2rrx64qm,"So this happened like 2 months ago.

So lunch comes around, i decide i want to make eggs and ramen, now i like to crush my ramen in when making eggs and ramen, why? No clue. Anyways, i crush the ramen, fill it with water and microwave it, then i make my eggs, i used 4-5 eggs, i put butter on the pan, make scrambled eggs, i plate the eggs on a paper plate, then i go place my pan and spatula in the sink, only to slip on water and kick a metal grate like it was the kick off to the superbowl. So im sitting here swearing so hard that it would make a sailor proud as a father teaching his child to ride a bike. My toenail (the top part) died instantly, so i had to clip it off. Theres blood all over my toe at the time, due to my stupidity. Turns out my dishwasher was leaking. Like badly. Also the toe next to my big toe was so bruised for so long youd think i had to of broken it.

Tl;dr made eggs for my ramen, slipped, killed my toenail, blood everywhere.",1
TIFU by licking a tampon,t2_14d4u0,"Im trying to be healthier these days since Ive gained a few lbs this past year. Its been stressful one 😅 So I decided to make myself a salad for lunch. Well i didnt have any dressing so I used hot sauce instead. I really poured it on because I like to torture myself with the deliciousness. So i finish up and start getting ready to leave the house. I always pee before I leave home because eww public restrooms. I realize Ive started my period, no problem, I'll just pop a tampon in real quick and get going. This is where I fucked up. Before putting in the tampon I licked the outside of the applicator so it goes in easy (LMFAO) if you know you know. After its in, my poor vashoon starts BURNINGGGG instantly I realized that I have lingering hot sauce mouth and that it transferred from the applicator to down there, making a whole new meaning of fire crotch 😂 After a few minutes of pain it slow starts to fade and Im able to go on about my day. I will definitely not make that mistake again but I will still continue to use hot sauce instead of salad dressing lol

TIFU by sending strangers to a completely random location.,t2_nu15jh9,"So this happened half an hour ago. I was on my train, half asleep. Two guys walk up to me and ask me if this is the train to station Oss (in broken English). I tell them it isn't and tell them I might be able to tell them which platform they need to be on.

Kinda sleepdrunk me forgot that I didn't use the current location but instead used the location of the previous train station.

So I open the app and navigate to the location they want to go to. I tell them to head to platform 5 where their train is which will leave in 5 minutes.
After they left I realized my mistake and walked to the door of the train but didn't see them anywhere, I couldn't come after them because my train was about to depart as well.

TIFU by Being a Bad Driver,t2_11hohh1a,"hi, figured if I shared this it would lessen my embarrassment and shame. I live in the Portland metro area, and I’m a student driver, been learning for the last 2 months, and I finished my last class about 3 weeks. Today, after my first drive, which I felt pretty good about getting the best score I could on, my dad decided to let me drive into the big city (we live on the Washington side), and get him to and from his work. While I was coming back, doing pretty not bad so far, I tried to merge onto another highway off of the 205 bridge, I forced another driver to change lanes because I couldn’t get myself out of the lane that was ending any other way, all because I didn’t plan ahead and was undeniably being a bad driver. I feel a lot of guilt. I know at some point every driver gets into an accident, but this was too soon. If anything, it was a good wake up call to the consequences of poor driving. anywho, that’s it, feeling slightly better but still acknowledge I mess up. Sorry for the poor formatting, just kinda decided to do this spur of the moment on mobile.

PS, sorry if this post was noticed multiple times, had to reupload because I’m poor at following the rules everywhere apparently.

TL;DR | I was a no good driver and the seriousness of the practice has truly clicked for me.",2
Tifu by almost ruining the holidays with an inappropriate picture,t2_37bbtfqm,"NSFW for obvious reasons

Obligatory this didn't happen to me today but rather on Christmas morning 2020. 

It was the first Christmas my girlfriend and I really got to do it up. Our son was around 15 months old at the time so we wanted to make it really special for him. 

For fear that he would start unwrapping the brightly colored shiny boxes under the tree, we decided to stash all of the presents in a spare room we have. The plan was to wake up extra early on Christmas morning, put all the presents under the tree, and wait for him to wake up.

Well the plan went off without a hitch. We woke up super early and got everything taken care of in about 15 minutes. It is now 6:45 AM and son is still out cold. I decided to go try and lay down to catch another 20-30 minutes of sleep, and my gf wanted to wait up for the kid. 

This is where it starts to go downhill. I go and lay down, but I quickly realize that I will not be going back to sleep. So I think to myself maybe we can have a little early morning ""roll in the hay"" if you will. So I decided that I'm gonna send m'lady a dick pic.

Now I, being the mostly out of touch millennial that I am, don't use snapchat that often. But I do know that people often use it to send nudes. Therefore, I decided to channel my inner young person and take care of this with modern technology.

After a few attempts I finally got what I thought was a pretty nice dick pic. Good lighting, angle, you guys know what I'm talkin about. I then add the words ""You want some Christmas dick?"" to the snap. 

While reviewing placement of the words, I decided that it wasn't festive enough. At first I thought there might be a Christmas light sticker, but I settled on a bow.

Here is the problem with being an old millennial and almost never using snapchat. I was looking around for the button that adds a sticker to the picture. Ya know that little button in the bottom left corner that looks like a little square with a + in the corner? Well my brain was like, oh hey that looks like an add sticker button. I tapped the button and it was gone. My glorious tribute to my manhood had zoomed off to lands unknown and I had no idea where. 

Immediately I started panicking. I quickly checked my story but I didn't see anything. Then I replicated what I had done but with a picture of the wall instead. Pressed the same button and ""poof"" it was gone. I then went back to my story and.... there it was. In all of its triumphant glory. 

Luckily, the view counter still said ""0"" and luckier still, I somehow knew how to delete a snapchat from your story. Just as quickly as it had come in to this world it was taken out. 

After my heartbeat reached a semi normal rate, I decided to get back in the saddle again and re do my masterpiece. Mission successful. After a good laugh with my gf, we ended up having a nice pre Christmas morning. 

I know the view counter said 0. But I wonder if someone, who was hoping to see pictures of our son on Christmas morning, opened my story. Only to be met with a very festive dick pic. Nobody has said anything yet so I guess we will see.

And now, every once in awhile, my head will randomly say ""want some Christmas dick?"" and I burst out laughing.

Tldr: almost ruined Christmas by posting a festive dick pick to my snap story.

Edit: Thank you for the gold! It's my first time getting some.",45
TIFU by buying a couch the same color as my cat.,t2_9pij543f," 

A local furniture mart was having a blowout sale, so we finally were able to get rid of our old ""parent surplus"" couch for something made in this century.

But it just so happens we also have a cat - a fat, spoiled orange-brownish lump we adopted from a local shelter. And his fur color happens to be EXACTLY the same as our new couch, especially if all the living room lights aren't on. Within 24 hours of bringing it home he happily claimed it as his new favorite napping spot, while we've nearly sat on him so many times we've lost count.

The nature of the sale means the couch is nonreturnable, and my wife would literally murder me in my sleep if I got rid of the cat, whom she loves very much. So we're going to be stuck doing ""seat checks"" for a very long time.

Be thankful you're so cute, cat!

TIFU I voted for Trump in 2016,t2_3qgmioa,"Obligatory: ~4 years ago. Instant regret.
I just wanted to get this off my chest. 

Alright so apparently I gotta actually type a bit more on here because there's a 750 minimum, and I'm not entirely sure how this sub's going to handle something so political. 

For one, I mean look at America right now. 

I honestly voted for him thinking that as the outsider, having never dealt with politics in the past aside from business, it might be a breath of fresh air for America rather than having another career politician going into office. I never expected such a ridiculous manchild overlord systematically dividing the nation race by race, but then again he did take his whole playbook, catchphrase and all, from Reagan. 

I really don't just wanna sit here and roast the president, but we seriously need the 25th Amendment or an ACTUAL impeachment soon. I don't mind Pence as long as it's only for a couple of weeks. 

Seriously I know this is probably going to offend a lot of Trump supporters, but really how can anyone actually support the man after all of this? He's no true leader if he actually has to have a swarm of cult-like followers storm the capitol building because he lost the election.

A real leader would've had everyone on the same page to begin with, without making anyone feel like they were sacrificing anyone's individual freedoms. He might have actually won the election if he hadn't tried to downplay a global pandemic, but that was just one of his many mistakes.

TL;DR America is GREAT",0
TIFU by using Delta-8 for the first time and not knowing its effects,t2_r8j7j,"TIFU for the first time like this.  Still reeling over what happened. It's been quite a crazy day and I swear I won't do it again.

I'm not a weed user, I am a cbd user.  I don't like the idea of getting high, either.  Which is why I did not expect the effects of using a brand new vape tank would be being high off my ass.

As best as I can remember (kind of having some issues remembering it but if I try hard enough...)  I recently was running out of my vape juice in one of the disposable tanks I occasionally buy.  Hadn't used the vape in such a long time but because of personal events I know that vaping gets the quickest results for me to try to relax.  Figured it was near time to purchase a new one.  I went to the site I usually go on to get my cbd items and I found it's been so long since I ordered a vape tank that they don't sell the ones I buy anymore.

Now, I have to say that before I go on, that I usually purchase plain old cbd with the smallest of thc.  I don't go any higher than 500mg as well.  But since I'm seeing new flavors I figure why not go for something different. After browsing  I come across a flavor called Apple Fritter.  I love apple fritters.  So I give it a quick look at.  Huh, Delta-8. 900mg.  Must be a new strain or something, no issues here.  I go and purchase it, wait a few days for its arrival.

I went and grabbed it today.  Got the box from my mail and went upstairs to my apartment.  I switched out my tank, turned on my vape stick, warmed it up, and took a puff.

INSTANTLY I realized I fucked up.  I can't breathe and I start coughing violently and uncontrollably.  I can't stop and it won't stop.  I end up throwing up once I crawl over to my shower.  Over and over again.  Then I begin to notice something is wrong with me.  I don't know how long it was till I figured out that I couldn't feel anything, my whole body felt fuzzy as if it fell asleep and I couldn't keep my eyes in one place.

I managed to stop throwing up and scramble to find out what is wrong with me while I am still coughing.  I refused to call 911 (American, I won't be in debt more than I am already) so instead after finding no results about what is happening to me, I somehow manage to get to my bed and spam call my partner to have him figure out what the fuck is going on.

I couldn't get a grip on reality.  I couldn't focus.  Every moment felt like it wasn't real, but also was.  I thought I was dying.  I was really scared and I started sobbing to my partner on the phone while he tried to see what he could do to help me (fyi he doesn't live in the same place and was completely unavailable to get to me).

After what felt like an eternity, with my sister eventually on the call with me as well, and as I lay there just feeling like I may be dying or tripping balls so bad I can't cope, we found out the reason for my reaction.

Delta-8 is a legal high. And I was having a very bad trip.

I didn't know that would happen!  I didn't think I had to look up what Delta-8 was, as far as I knew I thought it was a different strain of cbd.  There was no way I could tell that this would happen, and because I inhaled too much my body panicked and at the same time got so fucking trippin balls that I straight spiraled into a bad trip.

Thankfully I'm fine now.  I waited it out till I was lucid enough to call a friend and have him drive me to my sister's place where I waited out the rest.  I'm still a little high, had some munchies, and now that I barely feel the effects I am back home eating some ice cream.  But I will never, ever, EVER use Delta-8 again. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I stupidly didn't do my research on Delta-8 and in result had too much to inhale on my vape pen and spiraled myself into the worst trip as my first trip.",12
TIFU by accidentally seeing my parents’ sex tape,t2_49y2emtk,"My parents have been divorced for over 10 years and are neutral towards one another. They used to almost hate one another but now they’re okayish. A couple of months ago, I asked my dad If he still had photo albums and/or videos of me as a child. He took me to the attic and showed me a box with the name of my mother written on it. The box was filled with a couple of tapes and massive photo albums. I decided to look at the childhood pictures first and was too lazy to reinstall our old VHS recorder. I brought the box at my mom’s place and forgot about the tapes until yesterday. 

I wanted to have some alone time and decided to reminisce over my childhood. I attached the VHS recorder on my childhood tube tv, made some comfort food and watched some 360p resolution disney movies. As I became even more nostalgic, I decided to watch the tapes my dad gave me. I started getting a bit emotional yet happy to see me as a toddler, with almost no hair and my parents being happy together. I wanted to see more so I put on a new tape in the recorder. I waited for a few seconds before I could see my parents naked in bed, kissing each other and my dad proceeding to have sex with my mom (I barfed a bit while writing this). Never in my life have I jumped so fast and pulled the plug of the tv out. I felt like I’ve just watched the videotape of the ring. After building up courage for minutes, I closed the box, put it in the basement and made sure nobody was ever going to find that cursed sex tape again.

TL;DR My dad accidentally gave me his and my mom’s sex tape and now I’m traumatized

Edit: I’ll answer here the most common questions:

I didn’t destroy the tape since I have zero right to do so. It’s property of my parents so I have no business in destroying it even though I HATE it. 

The cursed tape didn’t go in the box with the non harmful tapes and has been hidden in a place where It wouldn’t harm others like it did harm me. 

I also have no idea how those tapes are still in pretty good condition. They have the same quality as they did back when I still had my innocence (the disney tapes)

For those with a similar story as mine, you’re not alone. Stay strong. 

And lastly for y’all freaks who wanted to see the tape, I wanted to Rick roll y’all but reddit wouldn’t let me do it",2898
TIFU by not knowing how to use my dishwasher properly for years,t2_91ivj6rz,"This may not be a huge TIFU to some, but it's been a revelation to me. 


Like most people, last year really took its toll on my mental health. People I loved have died and life has been about as sane and positive as a Trump tweet. 


Chaos has ruled my house. We've been home schooling two young children while me and my wife work demanding full time jobs in the room next door. We're lucky to still be working and have a roof over our heads, but trying to do it all at once has driven us into the ground. 


One of the most difficult things I've found is staying positive while our home looks like the before photo from an episode of Hoarders. 


Shit has been piled everywhere because we've just not had time to tidy. Everytime we get around to it, the job is so huge we don't do it again for another week and it all starts over again. I've felt completely out of control. 


Now here's my TIFU. Rather than empty the dishwasher I've always figured it just saved time to use clean stuff straight out of the trays. Why bother taking everything out at once when it's just going to be put back there anyway, right?


This week it occurred to just empty the dishwasher every morning and fill it with dirty dishes through the day. Then empty that sucker the MOMENT it beeps. No more shit piled in the sink or on the side, everything is where I can find it and we've not had to clean the kitchen all week.


It's such a small thing but it gave me a feeling of control I've not had for about 6 months. One less room of chaos, one less cleaning job to worry about and just a little bit less mental pressure on my blancmange of a brain.


For the life of me I can't understand why I didn't figure this out before. I'm a pretty smart guy, but for years I've dreaded going into my kitchen, let alone bring guests over. 


Tl/dr: Make space in your brain by putting dishes away.",23

Now I have a flight for which I'll have to miss out  on a meeting I was looking forward to , and I'll have to walk to  another terminal carrying about 50 pounds and land at awkward times.

Oh well.

TIFU by accidentally drinking my own body waste fluid,t2_xlw54,"Hello readers. As a setting to the story, I'm an over the road truck drivers, so most of my time I spent inside the truck, that sometimes, not all the time, include getting rid of bodily fluid inside a container, mostly empty bottles.

Today I was having mad sweet tooth, so I'm indulging my craving with the largest container of fountain soda Pepsi, think of it as 7-11 double gulp size. I finished that bad boy in less than 1 hour. Yes, I know, it's literally not good, but it's already in my system now &amp; I can't do anything about it.

As fast as it goes in, it's trying to come out as fast too, up to the point where I can't hold it anymore. As I'm in the middle of the highway &amp; not near rest area at all, I pulled over to the closest shoulder, stop my truck, put the hazard light on, and proceed to relieve myself. I wasn't thinking of using an empty water bottle where I can close with twist cap because I can't hold it anymore so I proceed to grab the closest container, which is the Pepsi cup container.

Here's where I set myself up for the screw up. Since it's a cup container, I don't dare to put it down on the floor, because it might tilt and spill, so I put it back on the only cup holder big enough to hold the cup, which is the one closest to me. It's only halfway full, so the lid on the cup will at least be able to prevent the content from spilling from the shake of the truck.

After a few hours of driving, a feeling of dehydration gets to me. Instead of grabbing a bottle of water, my idiotic brain thinks that since I bought the largest container earlier, there should be at least a little bit of Pepsi left in the container. I grabbed the upper part of the container, completely missed the feeling of the warmth of the content since it's only half full, also without looking at the color of the contents because I'm too busy focusing on the road, and proceed to take a sip.

In less than a second, I spat the content, getting my dashboard wet everywhere with an unimaginable smell, perform another emergency stop at the nearest highway shoulder, and proceed to gag on the nearby bushes. I grabbed my toothbrush and toothpaste and proceed to brush my teeth in the middle of the highway because this needs more treatment than just water gargle. On top of it, I also had to wipe my dashboard with lysol wipe. Luckily, the spat content doesn't damage any electrical parts of the truck, such as the radio and the ac/heater control. And I'm not proud of what I did, but I litter. Yes, I left that devil container on the side of the highway, and proceed to drive away, never looking back.

Please I beg of you to never ask me about the taste. Not only it's indescribably disgusting, but I can't even describe it, as nothing I've tasted so far in my entire life even come close to the taste of my own bodily fluid.

TL;DR: Relieving myself into the wrong container gave me the worst taste in my mouth, never again.

Edit: Many have asked, why didn't I just get out to do my business or dump the contents when I pulled over on the first shoulder? Because it was a very tight shoulder, as tight as a regular lane and on the other side is a guardrail that's literally inches away from my passenger door. I can't open that door &amp; I'll risk getting hit with incoming traffic on the driver side. As for rolling down the windows...foolishly I didn't think of that at all.",429
TIFU by recommending my favourite video game to my friend with epilepsy,t2_42x32cdz,"Obligatory apology for shitty spelling, grammar, etc. On mobile and it is 12am where I live, so I am really sleepy.

I'm going to start this story of by giving everyone reading this some much needed context. Bioshock Infinite is my (16m) favourite video game, and it has been since I first played it roughly midway through 2019. I loved everything about it and would definitely say it is a perfect game, anyway, let's save my long-winded review of Bioshock Infinite for another time and get back to the story...

On new year's day, my friends and I decided to have a ""virtual new year's party"" on a discord voice call. My friend with epilepsy (16f, I'll just call her ""B"") was in the voice call and she asked for some game recommendations for the Steam sale, naturally my dumb ass saw yet another opportunity to gush about Bioshock Infinite, and you better believe my dumb ass snatched that fuckin' opportunity up as soon as it could... 

I proceeded to give B a really long and in depth explanation as to why Bioshock Infinite is the greatest thing since tummy rubs, and how she should play it because it's perfect, etc... What I completely forgot to mention was that there are a ton of visual elements of the game that could cause seizures, as the fact that she was epileptic slipped my mind.

Fast forward to today, we were busy playing a game together when she told me that she just bought Bioshock Infinite (for its usual price) before we started playing, as she missed her opportunity to buy it when it was on sale, she then said ""OP, even though I bought the game, I still haven't opened it, because I forgot to ask you whether or not it could induce seizures""... 

I proceeded to apologize profusely and even though she could refund it, I offered to pay her back what the amount that she bought the game for, as I felt like it would compensate for me being the neglectful and shitty friend that I was, she declined my offer and told me that ""it's chilled, I should've asked""

Now I feel like a major asshole, and like I've been a really shitty friend towards B because I forgot to consider her epilepsy.

TLDR: Bioshock Infinite is my favourite game ever, I decided to recommend it to my epileptic friend during an online new year's party, she bought it today when the Steam sale ended, asked me whether she should be careful with potential seizures induced by the game, I feel really bad for forgetting to take her epilepsy into consideration when recommending the game",12
TIFU: Realizing I've been missing out on picturing things in my mind my entire life.,t2_6at9ag2q,"TLDR at the bottom.

First-time poster in this sub. So I'm scrolling per usual, as one does at 4:30 AM. Been poking around Reddit for a few hours and come to this TIFU post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu\_by\_explaining\_my\_synesthesia\_to\_my\_boyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu_by_explaining_my_synesthesia_to_my_boyfriend/)

Summary of that post: OP explains to her boyfriend about her synesthesia, realizes he has aphantasia and can't picture anything in his mind. Apparently, he's very upset.

Back to the present: Now, at 4:30 AM I'm very, very upset. I didn't know y'all got pictures in your minds, with full color and the like?! What the heck! I do not have that, so apparently, I have this aphantasia thing I didn't know existed.

Just woke my boyfriend up to ask if he can picture an apple instantly with full color, and yes, he can. He thinks I'm a weirdo for not being able to. He went back to sleep. I've been asked to picture things my whole life, as one does. I just think really hard about the words being asked, and still, darkness or I just continue staring at the scenery in the room. Always thought it was strange but went with it. Just thought it was a concentration/focus thing like make-believe. Didn't think you could SEE THINGS if you thought about them! I can't picture my house or my parents in my mind or anything at all. I didn't know anyone else could! Yes, I recognize things/people if I see them, but I can't picture them at all!

When I go to the dentist for cavities, my dentist tells me to picture wherever I want to be instead and close my eyes. So the entire time I'm at the dentist I always think ""pretty flower field"" over and over in my head, just sitting there with my eyes closed in blackness. Did I think it was weird? Yes. Did it distract me? Yes. But the rest of you can just teleport your mind to pretty scenery all the time?! I don't even fully believe it I'm so confused. Mad googling for the next few hours. I feel like I'm hyperventilating.

On a much smaller scale (maybe?) I feel like this is what people with color blindness feel like when they realize what they're missing?!

After starting my crazy googling, I realize some people with this mind blankness can't dream, but I do have vivid, image dreams. So I guess I have that going for me. I just didn't know most people could picture things whenever they wanted.

Apologies in advance if this post makes other people realize what they're missing. I'm so freaked out.

TLDR: After reading another TIFU I realized y'all can see memories and images in your mind and not just darkness or the normal room's scenery when thinking about something or closing your eyes. Sorry I sound so freaked out but I am crushed.

EDIT 1: Apparently, my mother has it too. She didn't know she had it, either. Dad can picture things perfectly fine. Research says they think it may have a genetic component, so there's that.",120
TIFU by confusing my olson's.,t2_hxz8x,"So this happened last Sunday. My sisters had come over to visit me and my wife.

looks at me, then looks at my wife

Me: She has lost it. It was a matter of time!

YS2: Bree Olson....*laughing laughing laughing*.....she is not...*wiping tears away*....Bree Olson is a *starting to crack up again but holds it*....she is a pornstar...*Starts laughing*

YS1: What are you talking about?

YS2 then shows us her phone, and in very clear words it says: ""Rachel Marie Oberlin, also known by her stage name Bree Olson, is an American actress, model, and former pornographic actress""

Both my sisters looking at me with laughter, and some shock. My wife looking at me with some shock, and a whole lot of embarrassment.

At any rate, my nose was like a faucet, so I took a break, went to a grocery store to get some medicine. I had never taken medicine in my life up to this point, let alone bought medicine due to dumb family beliefs. I understood the concept, but had no idea what to get for my cold. I asked a store worker what to get for a really bad cold. He told me, ""Get these ones. They're really good."" I thought to myself, okay, this cold is really bad, take triple whatever it says to take to really solve this cold. So I did.

I get back to the office and I keep looking at my coworkers laptop. He has this background picture of Andre Kirilinko, a basketball player on the Utah Jazz. Well, I did something rude about how I couldn't believe his agent would let them take such a terrible picture of him. All my coworkers laughed really hard. I thought, ""I'm so funny!"" So I made another joke that he looked like a manbearpig and he's coming right for us! Everyone laughed even more! So I just start railing on Andre Kirilinko's ugly face for like another 50 minutes with coworkers laughing like I'm hilarious (I'm sure I wasn't that funny, but I was drunk off the cold pills and thought I was Jerry Seinfeld with this primo material). 

Well, my jokes hit a lull and I decided to scoot over, closer to his laptop. My dumb F up was the entire night, but I looked at my friend's laptop and at the bottom, I read something. I said, ""What an idiot! They spelled his name wrong even! What MORONS!"" It was spelled ""Kirk-ilinko"" because my friend's name was Kirk. 

Then I looked at the face again and see that it was a crappy square Paintbrush Photoshop copy of Kirk's face on Kirilinko's body. I exclaimed, ""oh my gosh! That's your face!!! Ahhhagahaha! That's so funny! Oh my gosh!!! Ahahaha ! I'm so hahaha! Sorry! Hahahahaha!"" and all my coworkers were awkwardly laughing again and I couldn't stop laughing because they were laughing and vice versa. I was like an embarrassed hyena, red in the face, trying to apologize while laughing harder than I ever did in my life for some reason. I ran away to the bathroom cackling like a maniac, tears running down my face from it all. I'm sure the echoes of my laughter filling the empty floor sucked too. Another coworker, also laughing uncontrollably, said he'd drive me to the hotel, which he did. But I was still laughing the entire drive and all night until I feel asleep. The third friend that drove me home said it was funny because it wasn't anything like me, but didn't know why I kept going and going and going and that made it funnier because of how awkward it was.

The next morning, I apologized profusely to Kirk. He was so nice to forgive me, but I never have forgiven myself. I tried to buy him breakfast every morning for about two weeks, but he wouldn't have it. It's my most embarrassing moment of my life and I can't believe I was such an idiot and jerk. I still haven't touched alcohol to this day, partly because of this night.

TLDR: I got drunk on cold pills and made fun of my coworkers face for an hour straight because he photoshopped his face onto a basketball player and I didn't notice it was him, but made fun of the face relentlessly.

Edit: Wow! Thank you for an award! I don't know what to do with it, other than love it!",135
TIFU by not cleaning out my purse,t2_8c3ror0r,"TIFU by almost giving my manager a heart attack and embarrassed myself forever. 

Obligatory: I am on mobile, spelling, etc etc. Also this happened a couple months ago. 

For background: in retail stores the manager on duty (mod) will check your bag as you’re on your way out of the store at the end of your shift for loss prevention purposes. I was coming to an end in my assistant store manager role for a pretty large clothing company since I was going to enjoy the stay at home mom thing and go back to school. However, during one of my last days the bag check... it got me. 

I’m usually pretty good at keeping things out of my bag since I tend to just hoard things and never clean them out if I don’t do it immediately after I get home. One night the husband and I were feeling adventurous and purchased some ... toys. The thing is, we live with my parents and my mom tends to go into our space to “clean” aka snoop and go through our stuff (I know, we’re working on moving out). So on this particular night we turned off our phones, went to the local shady sex store, shopped around like a bunch of teenagers, went to town on each other while enjoying some time away from our baby for one of the first times. It was great, however we didn’t get to use our new toys because we got carried away and when we got back home and parked we decided to just shove everything in my purse and went in. 

Well, I didn’t work for about four days since I was transitioning off full time work and in that time I didn’t go out so I didn’t even look in my purse. Read: I totally forgot they were in my bag. 

The next work shift, I went in, worked, everything went well and my manager and I are talking about how hard it’ll be to deal with the upcoming season without an asm etc etc. The conversation got very emotional as we expressed how much we were going to miss each other. Then the conversation where my TIFU comes in: 

Manager: oh I’m the mod today, why don’t you bring your stuff up so you can clock out? 

Me: sure thing

So I very nonchalantly went to grab my stuff from my locker, my coat, etc. And went to show her. 

Oh. No. I remembered the *ahem* items just as I was unzipping my bag, now I could just refuse a bag check which would get me written up, or I could.... die on the inside and leave. 

I chose die on the inside and from her reaction I’m sure she did too. She peered into my bag and then looked up at me with big, wide eyes and muttered a “you’re good to go. Goodbye” 

Im just glad I didn’t kill this 63 year old woman from a heart attack. But after that I felt like I was dying and promptly dumped the items in a safe space when I got home. 

I saw her this weekend when I stopped by and my husband and I walked in and her eyes were really wide when she saw us and she looked at my bag “inconspicuously”. 

So, yeah. 


TLDR: TIFU by letting my manager bag check me when I had some *toys* in my bag that my husband and I bought in anticipation of some fun sexy times.",11
TIFU by Inventing a Fake Uncle and Being Really Sad That He’d Died,t2_80nsi1sw,"Three years ago at college

I had a close friend in college that I basically saw as a sister, but after some time I noticed she started acting weird. It took me a while to figure it out but I eventually pieced things together to that she was attracted to me and I guess expected me to reciprocate. I contemplated it because am dude but the image of me banging my sister and having to treat her as a partner rather than a friend resonated harder than my dick. Rejecting her was also a problem, because she was a close friend and no way that wouldn’t change after a rejection I assumed. So it’s a strange problem...

Dumbass me had a great solution tho: Just look less attractive! Now I had no beard I could shave or guy I could pay to kick my ass or anything. But more importantly, I also had no fucking clue why a girl - or any girl I’d had - would find me attractive. All I know is I’m tall, funny and have maybe good hair. So I turn to thinking what women find unattractive. Weakness! is my first and only thought. “All I gotta do is cry and whine about something in my life in front of her. Lies but white lies” I reasoned (im ok with occasional white lies from anyone idk) All that matters is she never know I lied. But also it’s still gotta be believable. So it’s gotta be something touchy. So I look at my mom’s side of the family which lives in Portugal and think “it’s genius I’ll just have a fake uncle and be really torn about how he’s fucking dead.”

Now I don’t remember it entirely, but I’m alone with this girl somewhere and I play my act. And man you should’ve seen the look on her face. Might as well had told her I’d fucked my dad or something. But it’s too late to turn this sinking ship around I say so I continue and wrap it up as soon as possible. She did give some semblance of an expected supportive response, but really I have no clue if or how she bought it. And regardless, instant regret bc was weird and made the shit a whole lot weirder. Attractive? Unattractive? Weird. Don’t remember too much after that other than it was def weird.

In the end things didn’t work out anyways, lost a friend, weird life moved on. Idk what I was thinking and I hope I never will. Next time I know what not to do tho. 

tl;dr told my friend my uncle died when really he never existed, so she’d find me less attractive and I could keep her in the friend-zone. Operation failed.",11
"TIFU by lying a lot about myself to a close friend in my hometown, for a decade, and I don't know how to come clean.",t2_55akb887,"tl;dr.
I've lied a lot about myself to a close friend in my hometown. I have a shit ton of guilt so I feel I should come clean. I want to tell them that I’m messed up in the head and I’m trying to get better. I just don't want to lose the best person from my childhood.


The friends that I made outside my home town, they know that I lie to their face, but they won't bring it up. 

Cause whenever there's hostility from outside the circle, I have their back big time.

That's one main reasons I think I still have the friends I made outside my home town.

I only recently had ego death and realised that I've been living vivid lies, and I didn't want to do that anymore.

Have been trying real hard for over a year to not lie to people I care about. 



I'm currently returned home and I'll hang out with this person this weekend.

Like my friends from outside my hometown, I'm sure this person also knows that I've lied to their face.

On top of that, they didn't get to see my better sides.

And overall, I have a shit ton of guilt so I feel I should 'fess up.




I’m not a textbook Narcissist.

I don’t talk bad about anyone, or put a person down. 

I just have a need to lie.

I concoct stories, jumble around parts of my life, play with the timeline, create a flow, add some extra pazzaz to make the story interesting. 

I convinced myself that it was all for entertainment and that I'm a pro story teller. 

I don’t even lie to improve my image, I don’t get any kick out of it, I feel like shit immediately after. But I just do it, like cruise control, my mouth just keeps moving.

/Nothing I’ve said is a 100% true, and nothing is a 100% lie./

But I can't quote Technicality and strengthen my delusions. 

I don't know if there's anything I can say to make what I did any less messed up.

I understand that I have no right to play with people’s trust.

And I am pretty sure that this person will lose their trust in me, and will want no contact with me.

I'll accept that outcome.

I don’t want forgiveness or acceptance or support.

I want to tell them that I’m messed up in the head and I’m trying to get better. 

I need the benefit of doubt that I have the scope to get better. For whenever we meet down the road.

I just don't want to lose the best person from my childhood.

If that does happens, I'll cope with it.

But I don't want this to happen.

Moral : Don't lie to people you care about, or to yourself. I understand that reality isn't great, but lying and living in delusions is much worse, overtime.",13
TIFU by hanging up on Lonnie from Nintendo Customer Support,t2_503rhz4i," 

Yesterday was looking through my old Wii games and decided I wanted to play some of them. I went downstairs to get the Wii U and hooked it up. The main user on the console was my dad, who has moved out and hasn't touched this Wii U in years. I tried logging in as my own account but couldn't remember my Nintendo Network ID password. After a hour of trying to figure it out, I gave up and called customer support. When I finally reached a real person, I got stressed. I have social anxiety! Lonnie, who sounds really nice, asked for my name and email. Now me being a kid still, I got really scared and didn't say anything. Then he said something along the line of ""Hello? Can you hear me?"" Yes Lonnie. Yes I can. Then I hung up. I'm sorry Lonnie. I hope the Nintendo Ninjas don't come to get me...

TL;DR  My social anxiety took over and poor Lonnie got hung up on",14
TIFU by showing a picture of my wedding dress to my fiancé,t2_8x6jkdtu,"
I (27f) was sitting on the couch with my fiancé (27m) last night watching our nightly show.

I guess I’ll preface this by saying...
Does anyone else absolutely hate Apple memories ? We were sitting on the couch and scrolling through Apple memories. It was a baby picture of me and then a picture of the puppy we had gotten last year. Then BAM it’s a photo of me in my wedding dress that I had taken the day I bought my wedding dress for our wedding next year. I immediately yelled the moment it popped up on the screen and turned the phone off right away and looked over at my fiancé. 

I immediately started crying and bawling out in tears. He says he swears he didn’t see it accept the neckline and that it has a v shape. Other than that he doesn’t remember how the dress looks. I don’t even know if he’s lying to make me feel better about it or actually telling the truth.

TL;DR: we were scrolling through Apple memories on the couch, and a picture of my wedding dress appeared.",1
"TIFU: By trying to show off to the wife, and buying an eighty dollar glass of whiskey.",t2_7xjeg,"My wife, best friend and I had a great weekend planned.  This was in the late 90's, and on Friday night, we went to see Dave Matthews Band at the Nissan Pavilion (Now Jiffy Lube Live), and Saturday night, my buddy had gotten us tickets for an acoustic Prince show at the incredible Warner Theater in DC.

He bought the tickets for us, and I was to reimburse him, so I took out enough cash from the ATM to pay him back for me and my wife, and to have some for a little pre-gaming at the Old Ebbitt Grill on Saturday night.

While we were waiting for him to finish up in the kitchen (He was a chef there) I sat at the bar, and thought I would impress my wife by ordering a glass of ""Their best whiskey, neat"".  The bartender poured out a nice glass of whiskey, waited for me to drink it down, and said ""That'll be $80.""

Feeling sheepish, I handed over the cash, plus tip (didn't have a credit card at the time, and I had maxed out my ATM withdrawal limit for the night, and this was before most places were set up to take payment from debit cards), so I no longer had enough to repay my friend. 

So by trying to be a big shot, I ended up screwing my friend (I got him back the next day, but it sucked that night) and my wife was definably NOT impressed, and our post concert plans were ruined.

  
Well, at least the concert was the best one I've ever been to, so I had that going for me...even if I felt like a butthead.

TL:DR Tried to impress the wife by ordering a very expensive glass of whiskey, ended up putting a big dent in our plans for the night.",30
"TIFU on my Vacation Trip to The Capital Building [Long, TLDR at bottom]",t2_1e4aowu,"Obligatory, this happened late December of 2017, but recent events made me think about posting this here.

This happened when my wife and I took our 2 boys on a little vacation in December 2017. We rented a 21' camper trailer and drove up from Florida through the Smokies and up to a campsite in New Jersey. On Christmas we went to New York City and had a relatively good time, despite being Floridians who didn't know how to deal with the cold.

After a couple days in New York, we had a tour of the Capital Building, so we made the decision to leave the camper in our spot at the camp site and drive to DC and back all in the same day- manageable, but a little stressful.

That morning after struggling to get our boys (ages 9mo. and 5 years) and ourselves ready to go, we realized we're kinda cutting it close on time- we have the last tour of the day and we need to book it to get there.

This is where I fucked up- I skipped my morning ""movement"" to make sure we'd leave on time, surely they'd have restrooms I could use somewhere along the way. After stopping to get gas on the way off of the turnpike, I checked the restroom and lo and behold, a line maybe 7 men long... I'd have to wait to take the Browns to the Superbowl until DC...

So after hours of driving, thanks to traffic we just barely made it to DC with what seems like JUST enough time to make it into the tour, and now my stomach went from uncomfortable to sharp cramps and PAIN. I've never had to poop so bad it HURT like this. Now we're trying to find a place to park and I'm getting MAD and my wife is trying to tell me where to go, all places that are either too far from the Capital Building or the lots are full- I tried to take some turns down streets near the building only to get turned around by Capital Police.

All the while I'm really yelling at my wife and being mean, she's laughing hysterically at me (letting my mean comments go because she knows my situation, bless her heart). I'm telling her I'm gonna just ditch the car on the side of the road for her to deal with while I run into the nearest building, but decide against it. Finally we realize we can park in congressional parking lot because there's no business being conducted that day.

As we're putting the boys' layers on, she informs me, ""The website said no strollers, by the way, we have to carry (our younger son) and carry only what we need... Great. Not only am I pinching my balloon knot as hard as I can to keep my brownie mix while struggling with winter layers on me and the boys that are completely foreign to a Floridian, now I have to physically exert myself more to carry him! And guess what, my puffer jacket is as slick as teflon! If I put him on my hip, he slides RIGHT OFF! Now it's 100% arm strength as we dash what seems like a mile to the entrance on the OTHER side of the building, and what-do-you-know? Strollers... Strollers everywhere. FFS, can this be any worse?

I'm about to explode, my leather cheerio is being subjected to pressures rivaled only by the eruption of Vesuvius. We inquire about the tour and they tell us ""you're probably too late, but there's the line"" Gesturing towards the 60 people with strollers and casual attitudes that only serves to infuriate me more. While in line, my wife mentions that she forgot her ID... Surely you can't get into THE Capital Building without and ID. I was just about to say ""FUCK IT"" and run off to a shitter somewhere, when the line starts to move and figure we might make it.

Finally make it inside and it is TOASTY - but now we have to go through security - we need to remove all of our jackets and everything, place it on the x-ray conveyor and walk through with our boys. OK, easy enough, right? Well not for someone who's not used to winter clothes, and DOESN'T HAVE A STROLLER. So now I'm walking through the scanner holding my youngest and my pants are falling down because I have no belt, and we're onto the other side, thankfully they didn't ask for IDs and we've seemingly made it. Now we're inside, but we have a whole HEAP of coats and jackets that its far too warm to put back on... so what do we do?

My wife came up with the good idea to just stuff it all into the baby's winter-suit (I forget the proper name) and that actually works, albeit it now looks like we have 3 children. Mind you, my stink-wrinkles are still under siege - but we're in, and we're coming up with solutions. The tour begins, I'm carrying our baby boy, and swinging around what LOOKS like another infant carelessly under my arm, and sweating.. Sweating profusely. Sweating so much that it's running down the crack of my ass and now I'm thinking there's a 50/50 chance I already lost- that my sphincter gave way to a mudslide. I'm so nervous that I try REALLY hard not to stand in front of anybody, lest they catch a whiff. Levels of uncomfortable I never imagined were possible.

The tour heads into a theater where they play a short movie - I couldn't tell you what it was about - ""THANK GOD"" I thought, SOME sort of reprieve from the misery that is my life right now - I can sit down!! - and maybe smell if something has in fact gone awry, cause up til now I'm just relying on my wife to tell me if she smells anything, but she's been laughing at me so hard I don't know if she even know's whats happening anymore.

Only our youngest didn't like the movie apparently, because as I sat down he began to cry... and cry loudly... Okay, I can do this.. just get up.. just walk around, he'll be okay and I can go sit down again... Up and down the whole showing, and my wife has tears in her eyes at this point... She's laughing so hard that she'd probably go weak at the knees if she tried to hold our boy, so I continue suck it up.

After what seemed like a showing of the Titanic, the tour continues and we're again, only now since we were at the back of the theater, we're at the front of the line, and I'm just trying to gauge people's reactions near me. Surely if they smelled my shit, they'd make some sort of sour face, yeah? As we're walking, I finally feel some sort of relief, like my body decided to give me a break and my colon just ""sucked it up"" for a bit, so despite my sweaty ass-crack, life is somewhat bearable, and I finally realize, hey, this is kinda cool, I'm in a really historic building here! Look at the art and stuff!

Maybe 15 min into the tour though, our youngest begins to cry and now he just hasn't stopped... and our 5 year old is getting a little impatient as he doesn't think a whole lot of what's going on as little kids tend to do... so we decide to finally just break it off and leave - only we're in the middle of the Capital Building and we have no idea where to go - we're going up and down stairs and getting turned around by velvet ropes and I'm asking every staffer I see where the nearest restroom is -

Finally we make it to the toilets and I hand off the baby and dart inside. It's a pretty full house in there, but there's an empty stall - I dart in and as I'm pulling my jeans, my thermals, and my underwear down, I feel it coming. No sooner do my cheeks hit the seat that the Hershey Highway unleashes Hell - Unashamedly disgusting every other man in that bathroom, and probably anyone within earshot in the hallway. Normally I'd courtesy flush, but it's all happening so fast that the thought totally escapes me. I deposit so much crude oil that there's a mountain in the toilet that it brings up feelings of nostalgia - to the first time I saw Jurassic Park when Laura Dern was elbow-deep in it.

There's so much relief I feel like I'm having a moment of clarity and realize how mean I'd been to my wife and I legit felt really bad about it. After taking a picture, then flushing and washing up and walking out as fast as possible (I'm sure it clogged) I walk out and apologize to my wife. She was super understanding and honestly found it funny as hell, so no harm done.

This became known as **The Crapital Hill incident**, and we still have a big chuckle about it from time-to-time.

TLDR: Didn't shit in New Jersey, went to DC with the worst poop-pains of my life, missed out on most of the tour of Capital Hill.",21
"TIFU by being branded a ""devil worshipper"" and possibly breaking the bonds of my family all because of Warhammer",t2_w41j861,"Opening Note: I wouldn't really consider myself religious by any means but the family member in question is Christian

This was late last night by the way-

For context, my aunt is one of those deep seated God fearing women that views anything outside of rainbows and ponies with even a hint of ""evil"" as ""satanic"" trash that needs to be purged from the earth- you know, basically anything in movies and games that normal people would consider fun.

Luckily the family I live isn't all that religious eithe like me but nonetheless this all started because I was interested in getting into the Warhammer universe, I had very little knowledge of the lore so I was just casually scrolling youtube looking through various videos on the subject.

I'm generally the type of person who when I am really into something, I don't usually pay attention to what's going on around me, that's probably where I actually fucked up.

My aunt for whatever reason decided to visit us and she is also the type of person to be shove her big fat nose into whatever everyone is doing.

After she talked with a few other of my family members that were here at the time and got into their business, she eventually got around to me and that's where shit hit the metaphorical fan.

Like I said earlier when I'm really invested into learning something I don't really pay attention to anything else, so I wasn't really concerned at the time about my aunt's presence and was watching a video about exterminatus- this video to be exact: https://youtu.be/ubNqUyf0op0

My aunt, to say the least was not pleased when she, quite rudely may I add stuck her giant nose into my phone and saw the cult imagery and the daemons featured in the video.

Without even giving me time to explain she immediately started yelling obscenities and saying incomprehensible things about blasphemy and how I was being tainted by the devil and my immortal soul was in danger and basically that my entire family would burn in hell because of me. I'm not particularly good at standing up for myself in person but after a few moments of my aunt's bullshit, a few of the not so religious family members I live with had enough of her and basically kicked her out of the house after a bit of arguing outside they all told her to leave and not come back. Cut to early this morning I wake up to find that my aunt's side of the family had blocked practically everyone on my side that was present at the time on every social media site they used and basically labeled us and damned and devil worshippers all because I just wanted to learn a little Warhammer lore.

Tl;dr: Wanted to learn about the Warhammer universe, ended up being branded a devil worshipper despite the fact I'm not even religious by fanatical Christian aunt.",69
TIFU by talking to a married man,t2_69x2ssyx,"As with most people, I also turned online to connect with others (aside from my family and friends) on the wake of lockdowns.

Back in July or August, I decided to try this infamous website that allows you to talk to strangers. Lo and behold, I was matched with this interesting guy. We talked for about an hour and decided we'll continue talking on a different platform. It was going great except that we're in different countries and we can't meet personally - which eventually turned out to be a good thing now.

Our entire interaction is obviously online. At the start, we used to talk every single day and as you might have already expected, after some time, we started fooling around. However, at some point our messages became sporadic. There were times that we wouldn’t speak for a week, or even for a month. I’m cool and didn’t think too much of it. In my head, we’re adults and there are adult things that we need to do.

Then last night just before I went to bed, I received a message from him. I decided to sleep and to open it the next day. When I finally opened his message, it was a photo of his wife and then a video of him taken by his wife. He really looked so fucked up on the video, I must say. Now I’ve been called a home wrecking whore even if I didn’t have a single idea that he was married. I thought of a lengthy reply defending myself, but ended up apologizing and saying that I wasn’t aware of the whole situation.

I feel so guilty that I am a part of this mess and that I ruined a marriage.

TLDR: Been talking to a man and today I received a message and found out he’s married.",13
TIFU by changing my New Year tradition,t2_9lltwovl,"This happened a week ago, but it's taken me until now to post.

So, it's nearly midnight on New Year's Eve. Normally, I'm in bed and fast asleep by the time the clock strikes twelve (I know, how boring) but this year I was both awake and in the mood for some amazing sex. Great way to see the New Year in, right? 

Everything was going great - that is, until I experience an agonising pain in my hip accompanied by a cracking sound. Sex most definitely at the very back of my mind at that point, I tried convincing myself and my partner that everything was fine and I did not need to go to hospital. Neither of us convinced by my feeble attempts to pretend I was OK, a scramble to get dressed (while I could barely move) so I could go and get it checked out.

One trip to A&amp;E, an awkward explanation, some x-rays and painkillers later, it was confirmed I had dislocated my hip.

I think I'll be sticking to my usual tradition of an early night next year!

TL:DR - decided sex was the best way to see the New Year in, ended up in hospital with a dislocated hip.",7
TIFU by watering my plant with vinegar,t2_3v4rd0dp,"I usually keep a gallon-sized bottle of filtered water near my plants for easy watering. Today, one of them was showing signs that it needed a good drink. Lucky me, there’s still a bit of water left in that bottle.

I opened the cap and happily poured water on my plant thinking, oh yeah, you’re gonna perk up real nice. As I was pouring, I got a whiff of vinegar but ignored it. Maybe someone just wiped this table with our homemade vinegar cleaning solution, I thought.

When I was almost done watering, I saw some algae on the bottom of that gallon-sized bottle from about 3 days ago and thought, hmmm, so letting it soak with vinegar doesn’t do a good job of removing the alg....... wait. WAIT. Hold up. Is this..?? Sniff sniff. SHIT. OH, SHIT.

I quickly dumped the wet, vinegar-y soil and repotted that poor plant with fresh soil. We’ll see how she does tomorrow.

I didn’t tell him I was making breakfast because I wanted it to be a lil surprise! He’s gaming in the other room. 

He washed the dishes earlier this morning and while the hash browns were cooking I thought I smelt soap cooking, this pans on the top right and the eggs in the bottom left (two biggest burners) so I leaned in to smell the “soap” forgetting I’m 5’3 and can’t actually reach over something, I feel the heat, the pain. “FUCK” my boyfriend hears from the other room. Not only did I ruin the surprise but I SIZZLED MY NIP. I also broke the egg yolk with my fucking nipple.

TIFU by letting my kids play outside.,t2_8nx3470j,"Obligatory, on mobile and this happened last week. 

I just moved across the country so I’m not used to my surroundings at all. I had to go to a town about 45 minutes south of where I live to get to a discount tire for a flat repair. 

Well. Being the kind and considerate person that I am, I took my 4 kids, ages 7 5 3 and 1, outside to play because it wasn’t bitter cold and there wasn’t snow. Big mistake. My 5 year old and 3 year old are still figuring out balance and developing a distaste for being wet. Where we were the grass looked very thick and luscious, but alas, it was not and tons of red mud lay dormant for my kiddos to sit in, and subsequently look like they crapped their pants. My 5 year old was less obvious in his jeans, but the 3 year old was wearing very light pink leggings. The cashiers at sams club were completely appalled at the appearance of my 3 year old’s behind. 

TLDR: I let my kids play outside, they sat in mud making it look like they pooped their pants, and I was just fine letting them walk around with poop pants.",17
TIFU by Drinking Tequila in Amsterdam,t2_8hgyc,"Obligatory, ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""

I had to fly to Holland for a job. My former boss and his wife have a house in Amsterdam, as the wife is Dutch. The plan is for former boss to fly in the following day and his wife the day following him. I arrive at the house and unpack my things. I then explore the city a bit and return to the house without incident. If you've been to Amsterdam, you know that bottled liquor sales end relatively early, due to excessive partying. However, former boss being the rich douche that he was- had an extensive liquor cabinet and an even more impressive champagne rack. In a few moments, you'll understand why these two bits of info tie together info into a fuck up.


Some time later, I decided to go out and see the night life. After only one turn of a corner, I happen upon two lovely-looking young ladies in what seems to be a minorly distraught conversation. I decided to ask if everything was ok. To which they replied they had forgotten to buy liquor before the stores stopped selling and were trying to figure out what to do. I mention the fully stocked liquor cabinet at my place around the corner.


They were understandably a bit apprehensive at a tall, foreign, male stranger offering them liquor and said they would wait at the corner if I went to get booze. ""What do you like?"" I asked, not wanting to miss an opportunity to drink with such good looking company. God blessed Dutch women's looks, truly.


""Tequila.""


I quickly returned to the house and grabbed an ordinary-looking bottle of tequila off the shelf. It seemed to have had a drink taken from it already. A safe bet, I reasoned with myself. Long story short, we proceeded to get hammered on the tequila at their place and then went out dancing all night. In the end, I was towed home sitting on the back of a bicycle, in true Hollander fashion. 


The next day, my boss arrives. I was passed out on a couch in the living room. I heard him coming in; so, I got myself up. He still had his bags in hand as he stopped in front of the liquor cabinet for a long moment, his gaze glued to it. With a hint of fear in his voice I'd never heard before, he says, ""Where's the bottle of tequila that was here?""


""I drank it last night with some girls, why do you ask?"" A bit unnerved as to why it had garnered such immediate attention and tone.


You're probably thinking to yourself right now, ""OP drank some ridiculously expensive bottle of tequila."" You'd be wrong. It's much, much worse. &gt;!""That bottle was the final gift my wife received from her mother, before my wife's mother passed away. I'm going to need you to go find that bottle. Now."" (Keep in mind, wife is flying in the following day)!&lt;


Obviously, I began shitting bricks. I had no idea who these girls we're or how to find them and they had that bottle- assuming it had not already been recycled. &gt;!Thankfully, it was a super common bottle of tequila and I simply purchased a new one from a liquor store to replace it and everyone lived happily ever after. The end! !&lt;


TL;DR  &gt;!Drank a bottle of tequila that was a final gift from my boss' wife's mother to my boss' wife.!&lt;",5
TIFU by not speaking for a day,t2_7mq7l84m,"TIFU by not speaking for a day

So it was Sunday and I was bored and decided to have some fun with my family,I couldn't sleep and I didn't speak even in the night or when I was alone. It was complete hell but I really wanted to see how they would react. They didn't know I was doing this so whenever they asked me a question I wouldn't answer and as it usually does it got to the point where they would say ""don't say anything if you want me to break your phone"" they did do everything they said but I still said nothing. After the day was over it was Monday and now they wouldn't talk to me but after I threatened to eat their food they stopped and as I'm writing this they are being annoying until I apologise but I will leave that up to you  


TL:DR I didn't speak for a day and my family wont speak to me and now they are annoying me

"TIFU by not stretching my legs, causing me to blackout while trying to use the bathroom.",t2_zt7xv," 

So I have a god awful amount of health issues. I'm not sure if it's because I was a really premature baby, or if I just lost the genetic lottery, but ever since I was a child I've struggled with chronic pain and illness. Unfortunately, much of that time was spent with doctors not believing the severity of things, telling me that I was overexaggerating or that it was growing pains, so the few coping skills I do have are not always effective, much less so than being on a medication or treatment plan.

Today's two relevant issues are chronic joint problems and probable endometriosis. I have pain in nearly every joint in my body, they're often stiff, and in the case of my knees, they frequently pop out of place, causing extreme pain. While I'm still working out the endo stuff with a doctor, to avoid TMI one of the biggest problems is for some reason my bladder will randomly scream at me telling me to go pee, whether or not I actually have to go. This is was one of those times.

I'm chilling on my computer, trying to get some school done, when the alarms start ringing. So, instead of stretching my legs slowly and massaging them into working order like I usually do, I stand up and waddle to the bathroom, trying to ignore the shooting pains down my stiff legs and avoiding stepping on my cat who absolutely loves the bathroom. I sit down to do my business and this is where I fuck up. My knees, at the same time, crack out of place. It's hard to describe what it feels like, but imagine someone taking a hammer to both knees, followed by a sound like a very large nut being cracked. Of course, I was only vaguely aware of the noise because at this point I'm, already dizzy from the pain and my vision is quickly fading.

An unknown amount of time later, I'm guessing less than a minute based on previous blackouts, I wake up on the floor, in a puddle of my own pee, cat losing her mind on the sink above me. Thank god I missed the drawers beneath the sink because what a fucking *great* time explaining that to an ER doctor while getting stitches would be. I'm calling to get in with my PCP and scheduling physical therapy now.

TL;DR: Didn't stretch before going to use the bathroom. Knees ended up cracking, resulting in me passing out from the pain, almost peeing on my cat in the crossfire because she's clingy and wanted to play in the sink.",11
TIFU by encouraging my fiancée to fact check.,t2_22supusa,"So the outcome of this is literally happening as I type this out. First, a little context. My mom is verrrry left on the political spectrum. My soon to be MIL is at complete opposite end of it. I understand that politics has had some really bad repercussions over the last couppe of years for some families, but I am just now beginning to witness it first hand. My mom made a post on FB about condemning the invasion on the U.S. Capitol. Someone commented on it basically saying that Antifa is planting people in there to make the right look crazy. My fiancèe showed it to me and said she can comment actual substance to disprove these comments and I encouraged her to do so because I honestly think the truth should be shared, especially if someone is passionate about the subject. So she linked her research and my mom thanked her for the backup and the other person didn't have a reply to it and that was the end of that...until it wasn't. My soon to be MIL basically commented that everyone should keep an open mind and that there's a lot of fake news being spewed by the media. She argues that Trump has done a lot of great things that the media doesn't acknowledge and that people shouldn't make rude comments about her president. My mom didn't realize who made this comment, and immediately replied that MIL is one of the idiots who blindly follows Trump and that if she agrees with him, then she's a traitor. She immediately apologized after realizing who it was and tried messaging her and texting her, but shes been unfriended, blocked, and now my fiancèe is having a pretty heated political discussion with her mom. We've tried apologizing on behalf of my mom, but MIL is airing out aalllll of her political beliefs. Man I can't wait until the wedding! /s

tl;dr: TIFU by starting a FB war between mom and MIL and now there's trouble in paradise.",37254
TIFU by deleting 11 years of weather data at work,t2_qpkzo,"Obligatory happened a couple hours ago.

I work at a regional mesonet (weather station network) and today I was doing quality control by moving obviously bad data. These are mainly things like temperatures around -100°C, daily rainfall values exceeding 2,000 mm, and other observations that definitely aren’t going to happen within our network.

For one station, I was trying to remove data for July 29, 2009 from 17:15 to 20:00, but accidentally put the end date/time as July 29, 2020 at 20:00 instead. This deleted eleven years worth of temperature and dew point data for that site.

I was very happy when our IT guy told me that not only was the data backed up (which I expected and was hoping to be the case), but it was actually a pretty straightforward process in the same page I used to remove it. 

Unfortunately, now I get to go through and do quality control on that eleven years of data because replacing it with the raw data also included data points that were previously removed when someone went there to do maintenance (including cleaning or replacing the thermometer). I’m hoping this doesn’t take too long, but it’s possible that it’ll take a few days to go through.

TL;DR - Accidentally typed 2020 instead of 2009, so instead of removing four hours of bad data I removed eleven years of mostly good data. Now I get to do quality control on the entire batch because of how I had to restore it.",209
TIFU by getting caught hiding my dad's porn CD in my textbook,t2_8skicbnk,"So this happened a few hours ago and with no other option I thought of sharing this story with the fellow internet people and make myself feel embarrassed...

Few days ago when I was high off my ass and was sparked with the idea of going through my parents closest for some reason and find whether the house that they owned was transferred to my name..... I honestly donno why I thought this but I did.... So I open the closest and reach my hand far in and I find a plastic cover filled with something.... I took it out and saw it was a yellow cover and I open it find a butt load of CD's.... Now my curiosity peaked and grabbed one of the CDs and forgot for what reason I had come for.... Surprise surprise I find ""sexy busty ladies"", on the cd with a rather hot looking girl with her bossoms hanging in a open field.... They seemed like a generic brand of CD's with stickers of women flaunting all over... I mean I did know my father was rather pervert in nature but didn't know he actually had some rather interesting choice of porn collection....

Some people know that sex drives are rather common when a person is high and this is what I exactly I should have got for me to pleasure myself while being high...
So I grabbed one of the CDs and put it in my laptop and had my most profound fap....

For some reason nothing spectacular actually happened and the day went on as is... This happened last Monday by the way and I took the CD I masturbated to and hid it inside one of textbooks that was lying around.... And proceeded to keep the book in the book shelf where I had left my books in a messy manner... 

Should have relized that I shouldn't have left my books in such a way but I didn't because again I was high... 
And my mom had to observe this and had to come herself to clean the book rack herself this very day when I was home...

I knew something was wrong somewhere and had a sixth sense that something was about to happen as my mom for my bad luck was going through my book shelf because she wanted to keep it in a tidy manner.... I knew I had left something there but couldn't quite catch it in my head what it was....

So I panicked and went as fast as I could and I heard a thing fall on the ground as I came down the stairs ( our floor is made of wood and had no carpet btw).... And there it lied in front of me and my mom....
 "" Japanese young erotica* 
I turned back and went back from where I came from and haven't seen her face again, also didn't go out and I'm sitting here telling this story.

TL;DR  Don't store your porn in dumb places that too your parents porn collection and speaking of consequences there hasn't been any as I have not seen my mom's face from the time this happened few hours ago

TIFU by accidently showing a colleague a dick pic,no author,"I had more or less surpressed this embarrassing moment, until I read another FU today with a guy showing his family a video of him and his girlfriend... as you might have guessed, this happened years ago but its still painful to think about!

So when I was younger I liked to take photos/videos of me and my girlfriend during sexy times, unfortunately around the same time we were days away from moving in together. We had recently visited the house and took plenty of pictures - you can probably see where this is going...
I was on a late shift at work with ""Bob"", we had worked together for a few years and got on well, occasionally going out for drinks etc on the weekend. This day was like any other, we were chatting about random things when I mentioned the house. I pulled my phone out to show him some pictures, I had them on fullscreen, slowly swiping through them ""Here's the garden, the garage is full of old junk, front room is decent.."" Awkward silence ""I... umm.. shit"". I swiped across to a picture of my girlfriend with her mouth full of.. well, me..

We both sort of froze for a few seconds while we processed what we were looking at, he just said ""are you fucking serious?!"" and walked off! As I said, we got along well but I was terrified of him reporting me. He came back a few minutes later and just said ""I can't believe you just did that"", I said how sorry I was but the damage was done.
After that night there was always a bit of awkwardness between us, we didn't go out on the weekends again but he didn't report me or mention it to anyone (that I know of). He left the company for another job about a year later.

I haven't seen him since but I wonder what he would say if we bumped into each other now...

TLDR: Showed a colleague a picture of my third leg in my girlfriends mouth, friendship basically ended right there.",10
TIFU by hitting on my ex-boss's boyfriend,t2_4rj4hgex,"SO this happened a few days ago but the post wasn't long enough, so I'm re-writing.  The other night I was watching Instagram stories, as one does, when I came across a fun post from my ex-boss.  (Stopped to interject - I worked as an ambassador for a company (lol) and she oversaw the program.  I quit pretty quick into it, and she was let go before that, but we followed each other and were on pretty good terms).  She had reposted a post from a gym where there was going to be a free class.  The class was on rowing (my sport), and featured a (tagged) picture of a cute rower.  

My first FU was assuming that she just wanted to spread awareness of the class.  The second, and much larger FU, was being too bold.  I believe in DMing guys first (why not??), so I clicked on his profile, saw he was private, and messaged him to say, ""I saw you on Instagram (bonus for being a rower) and I just wanted to say you're super cute :)) have a great day).  

As any great texter does, he replied about an hour later and said ""Hi *shouldidrophim*, thank you I appreciate that!  My girlfriend X thinks so too, I think you knew her from Y!  I hope you're having a good 2021 so far, have a great day yourself""

I apologized profusely and was forgiven, but I can never reply to my ex-boss's stories ever again.  yikes

TIFU by eating my butt crack hair. TW?,t2_9mppahug,"Throw away account because *gestures at title*

Everytime I poop, I go shower immediately after. It's just something that has been ingrained in me (by me) from a young age.

This morning, I did my business and then headed into the shower. I shampoo'd my hair since this was my first shower of the day, and I washed the shampoo away. A strand of hair got in my mouth and I struggled to get it out. I did, eventually, and I washed it away noting the size since I had recently (a month ago) shaved my head.

Part of my showering regiment is to soft scrub my lips. I started to do so. My butt crack itched, so I just reached back and scratched it, then went back to scrubbing my lip. A few seconds later, I felt a hair in my mouth so I tried to get it out. I struggled again and it moved to the back of my mouth. I opened my mouth to the shower and got some water in there and tried to gurgle the hair forward. I did, and I pulled it out. I looked at it noting the size of it, and it was twice as long as the hair on my head.

I began to wonder were it was from I plucked a hair from my arm pit and compared the size and it was off, so I let that hair flow away with the water. I kept wondering where the hair that long was from... And then it hit me...

I immediately let it go, flowing away with the water, and I threw up all over my freshly cleaned body at my disgust. I took a long moment to compose myself, before I turned the water to a hotter temperature and begin to clean everything up, turning my normal 20 minute shower, into an hour long ordeal... 


TLDR: I put a butt crack hair in my mouth, and threw up cause I'm an idiot.",4
TIFU eating an unknown chili,t2_72lbfsmz,"TIFU - well not actually today, but the poor guy drinking peppermint oil to relieve his stomach ache made me think of this episode from a couple of years ago.

My wife and I had a friend couple over for dinner and were sitting talking after dinner, playing board games and having a laugh and a few beers.

Introducing a case of ""boys will be boys"" and me remembering that we had a bag of mixed chilli peppers in the fridge. The chilis were grown by my wife's colleague and handed to us in a neutral bag containing a mix of different kinds. Some were relatively mild... Others not so much.

My friend and I decided to do a chili taste. Starting out with a brownish one, that was hot, but with a nice taste.

Afterwards we decided to go for a small red curly looking one. We googled and it looked like a carolina reaper - at the time the hottest chili in the world.
 We cut it in half and - bottoms up - ate a half each...

Quickly regretting that decision.

I started sweating and my mouth was on fire, but I stayed in my seat and handled it relatively well. My friend instantly started hicouging, drank like a liter of milk to soothe the pain and within minutes was on his knees making his offerings to the gods in the great porcelain bowl with a built in flush.

The evening kind of died and our friends went home. My pain recided and I went to bed with my wife.

Fast forward about an hour and a half, I wake up with a stomach ache and try to go to the toilet. Long story short, a few minutes later I'm curled up on the floor in the fetal position clutching my stomach with the worst stomach ache I've ever experienced, calling for my wife.

It feels like my bowels have exploded and I'm dying.

My wife calls for an ambulance, I'm picked up, taken to hospital and kept over night for observation. Of course nothing's actually wrong and hhey sent me home the next day - picked up by my parents in law 🤦‍♂️

Besides the stomach ache and my ass being on fire, when taking a dump the next three days no dumbasses were hurt in the making of this story.


Tl;dr: Boys will be boys decide on eating chilis for the fun of it - end up in hospital.",33
TIFU by ignoring the class action lawsuit regarding shampoo and conditioner.,t2_2fcf98c6,"I am sure most of you have seen the lawsuit against basically every Walmart brand shampoo/conditioner.  I ignored looking at this for a long while because usually it is a bizarre scenario or doesn't pertain to me. Well, this one happens to include most of the shampoos and conditioners I use or have used regularly for years.

Back after high school I switched from the salon grade products to generic to cut costs some. At that time I still used hair dye pretty regularly. I just assumed I had damage from the dye itself, not the products I had started using. 

After both pregnancies I experienced hair loss when I quit breastfeeding, and I thought it was just the normal hormone changing hair loss and dismissed it.

I saw a post about Suave and disregarded it because I don't use it. Then I saw a few different ones and finally decided to look into it. Whoops!

So I switched back to the products I used to use, and seriously have used it once and can tell a difference. I can't believe for years I have been saving about $12 on shampoo and conditioner and have been losing my hair because of it! 



TLDR: switched from professional grade hair products to generic because it's cheaper- now there is a lawsuit against generic companies for hair loss. So, after saving some money and losing a significant amount of hair, I am now buying the professional products again.",4
TIFU by stammering during class,t2_1k0uzsx2,"I've had a history of getting stuck while I talk but it comes in waves. This time I was talking and I had all my thoughts laid out perfectly yet I opened my mouth and find myself using a substantial number of filler words. Then I encountered a couple of problem words and rushed through the thesaurus of my brain to find substitutions and couldn't, and there was this silence for a whole seven seconds approximately. I was BEETROOT RED. The professor said - you seem s bit disorganised - you seen to sound a bit garbled - should we come back to you on a while? I was now flaming red. Unmuted myself on the call, took a deep breath, and concluded with a final point. The prof was a sweetheart about it. He was like, yeah, fantastic point there - and continued his lecture and elaborated on it. I know others probably wouldn't care but this sort of thing really messes with my stuff esteem.

TL;DR: stammered and embarrassed myself in front of an online class of 20 odd people. Also needed the prof to acknowledge my fuck up when I got out of breath in the middle.",4
TIFU by needing to take a shit at target,t2_6dm9anr9,"Not today but a couple days before christmas. 

So i woke up that morning just ready for a full day of looking at porn and memes. I might have even spiced it up and cried a little bit. But then it happend. My gf texted me and asked if i wanted to go help her with christmas shopping. I was quick to jump out of my bed in which i wallow in self pitty. I took a shower, brushed my teeth due to stinch of rum, and then i was ready to go. She picked me up and her mom and sister were in the car, a crutial part of the story. 

Our first stop was at a strip mall down town. We stayed there for a few hours when it hit me. I hadnt taken a shit that day yet. We then left and went to the mall. My unborn chocolate child still brewing up in my butthole. We went to dinner and food only made it worse.

Then, we went to target. We walked around for 2 hours. My gf, her sister and i walked around while her mom did christmas shopping for them. My massive turd was now under imense preasure and was liquifying. After having walked around for a while still boiling my butt stew, i realised that i wasnt gonna hold it until i got home.

When the time had come i walked up to my gf and said to her ""my butt baby is crowning, its an emergency"". I rushed to the bathroom and barely got my pants down. I started shitting before my cheeks even hit the seat. 

Herea the best part of the story. At target they have the toilets that flush like literal jet engines and are almost impossible to clog. Well i clogged that jet engine toilet. I could not have texted my best friend quick enough. He was so proud of me. 

The rest of the story just involves an awkward car ride home bc target was the last stop of the day. 

Tldr: my gf took me shopping, i didnt take a dump that morning resulting in an explosive catastrophe in a target bathroom. 

This came really close to breaking rule 4 but not quite.",35
TIFU; noise canceling headphones worked TOO well.,t2_xixg3,"Now I have no wallet and *might* get fired.


Obligatory this happened yesterday as I've been running around trying to fix everything. 

New headphones for Christmas (thank you parents !!) They were kind and sent me a pair saying ""Merry Christmas NecroPastoral, hopefully these will help you relax"" lol. 

Never had real noise cancelation before. Just studio monitors earbuds, etc. 

Fell in love with my favorite music all over again and was addicted to the experience. Not realizing it's a bad idea, I went into town to get some errands done for work...without taking them off.

 Drove there, got out of the car went to home depot, did self check out went back to the car.

 Took out my keys, my *wallet falls out of my jacket*, I DONT HEAR IT OR FEEL IT FALL, STILL WEARING THE HEADPHONES (I had gloves on which didn't help) hop in the car, come back to work and..... Oops no wallet to swipe back into the parking lot. 

I should have just called my boss and fessed up, but I wanted to save face like an idiot, so I drove back. Found my spot. No wallet. Spent an hour trying to find it, went into the store to ask, nothing. If I had just accepted I was screwed I wouldn't have pissed my boss off so much by being an hour longer than I should have been. If I hadn't actually lost my wallet he would have fired me. So silver lining I guess. 

TL;DR - got headphones to help relax me, worked too well, lost my wallet and maybe my job.",653
TIFU by ordering both Krystal’a and Domino’s.,t2_2fisgjuu,"So this TIFU just happened and it’s kinda funny. So I had just gotten off work and decided to smoke a blunt and some of a dab pen. My girlfriend and I got pretttyyyy high and just chilled out listened to music and played Rocket League. Eventually we got the all consuming munchies that occurs... and realized we didn’t lay out any food.
First we tried to DoorDash some Krystals... the total ended up being around $30. After waiting on it for 1.5 hours stuck on “Preparing your order.” Without actually having a driver yet. 
Long story we ended up ordering some Domino’s... cause they are always open for delivery. That also totaled out to $30..
We were under the impression that the Krystals order had cancelled since they closed before we found a driver..... we soon found this was not the case.
We got our Domino’s order. Ravenous with hunger, we prepared to eat the delicious feast of the domino gods. 
Right as we began I saw more headlights in our driveway... we live on the end a tiny road that no one else is on and has not outlet. So to find an unexpected car in our driveway at Midnight is odd. I came outside with a knife in my pocket ready for war. Not knowing what I was to find down my stairs in the driveway... 
Behold... the doordash driver! With our ..... Krystals. 
So... we got $60 worth of food. For two people.
I guess the lesson here is don’t order food when your high. Or just stupid in my case.😂

TLDR; Got high, ordered Krystals, got impatient, ordered dominos, received both at a grand total of $60 USD.",32
TIFU by falling asleep wearing earbuds,t2_12qc8t,"So our story begins in March of 2020 (10 months ago). 
One fateful night, I was posted up in bed, listening to music with earbuds (the kind with the little rubber pieces that go in your ear (this is important)).  My usual plan when I do this is to, at some point before I fall asleep, remove the earbuds from my ears, and fall asleep, so as not to damage the earbuds. This was not a very realistic plan, and almost every night I did this, I would fall asleep with the earbuds in.
Usually this did not cause any problems, as the earbuds would gradually make their way out of my ears over the course of the night, and I would retrieve them from out of my blankets in the morning. 
This March morning was no exception, and I woke up without earbuds in my ears. While retrieving the ear buds from my blankets, I noticed that one of the little rubber bits was missing. I didn’t think much of it, as I lose them all the time and I had plenty of extras, so I replaced the rubber bit. However at that point I started to notice a shooting pain in my right ear. It felt like I had ruptured my ear drum again (I ruptured both ear drums on 2 separate occasions over the course of the previous year), so I went to my University’s Student Health Center. 
The NP there didn’t see anything wrong with my ear, but she gave me some ear drops which I used. 
A few weeks later it had not gotten any better, so I went to urgent care. Same result, doctor didn’t see anything, gave me ear drops. 
Repeat one more time after another couple of weeks. 

At this point I had really stopped caring about it. I had gotten used to the pain and the lack of hearing, and I didn’t think about it until maybe last month. 

Last month my hearing in my right ear got noticeably worse overnight. It didn’t even cross my mind to go see a doctor until yesterday, so I made an appointment with a real ENT doctor for this afternoon. 

Fast forward to the doctor sticking medical instruments in my ear. 

Dude asks, while looking inside my left ear (Not the one that hurts) if I wore earbuds often. I told him I had not worn earbuds since March, the day I noticed this pain.  He says ok, and moves to my other side. 

He starts removing some wax, then asks once more,

“When was the last time you wore earbuds?”

“March”, I said.

“That’s when the issue started?”, he asked.

“Yes”

“Well I think I found the root of the problem”

Doctor shows me the rubber earbud bit he had just pulled out of my ear. I am now laughing hysterically.

The doctor was really nice, we were both joking about it, and now I can actually hear out of my right ear. I feel like a new man. 

I’ll put a related picture in the comments. 

TL;DR: Fell asleep wearing earbuds one night, felt a strange pain in my ear the next morning. Didn’t realize for 10 months that there had been a rubber earbud thingy lodged in my ear canal.",126
TIFU by trusting an untrusty toot.,t2_76osv,"There I(31F) was, sitting in the Arby's drive thru, when all of a sudden I felt like I had to toot. Nothing crazy, just a little tiny toot that would go completely unnoticed seeing how I was alone in a car. Also, it's not like I've been sick so what's the worst that could happen. Well, I found out real quick what the worst could be. I had just got done ordering so I go to roll up my window and as soon as it closes I let out my little toot. In a split second that tiny toot turned into liquid warmth and I'm just like, ""oh shit!"" I look around in the back seat for anything to help me out while also rolling my two front windows halfway down because holy god, that smell. I finally find an extra Aldi's bag to put under me so I don't end up getting poo on the heated leather seats, and I notice the people in the car in front of me looking back at me like, ""what the..."" Mind you, it's about 25 degrees Fahrenheit, so I look like a crazy woman rolling up to the window with my winter coat and hat on, and my windows half down. Then, when I get home I have to explain to my 11 year old how I need his help bringing food in because I've shit myself and have to clean up before handling food. He then tells my husband what's going on as I'm booking it up stairs to the bathroom. When I finally came back down, it was 100% the walk of shame. My husband, 11 year old, and 4 year old were waiting for me at the bottom and as soon as I make eye contact with them, my 4 year old just started busting up laughing and saying, ""Mommy pooped her pants! Mommy pooped her pants!"" And then the rest of us started busting up because who's not going to laugh at that? A 4 year old uncontrollably laughing at his mom because she had an untrusty toot.

TLDR: I trusted an untrusty toot while grabbing food for the family and at the end of my walk of shame everybody laughed lol",20
TIFU by getting drunk before flying home from Mexico,t2_3nji3qyj,"Obligatory this happened a little over a year ago, but here we go:

Rewind to November 2019, I'm flying home from Mazatlan with my best friend. We were looking at a long flight home with a 2 hour layover at LAX before flying back to WA. I had been drinking before the taxi picked us up from the resort, at the Mazatlan Airport having 2 margaritas, as well as several drinks on the plane. 
Fast forward, we land in LAX and stop at the bar for some drinks while we wait for our plane. Had 2 mojitos, I think? Things are kind of blurry at this point. We board out last flight from LAX back to Washington and I order one final shot of crown. At this point I was wasted. And what happens when you are wasted? You have to pee. 
I wander into the bathroom at the front of the plane, just past 1st class, drop my sweats and start the empty the tank. 
Now here is where I fucked up. 
I vape, and I carry my vape with my in my pocket so it doesn't leak in my purse. 
Without even thinking, just being drunk on a plane, I take THE FATTEST rip off my mod and blow it straight up into the smoke detector. 
*fire alarm intensifies*
BEEP BEEP BEEP 
*BANGS ON DOOR, ""MA'AM??*

I realize what I have done, open the door with my pants around my ankles and a cloud of peachy blueberry shame comes out, and all I can say to the flight attendant staring at me is, ""it's perfume??""

This was the worst walk of shame back to my seat y'all. I thought the flight marshal was going to cuff me then and there. 
I get back to my seat and the flight attendant confiscated my mod which I handed over willingly as I was sobbing. I thought I was going to get arrested. 
I cry myself to sleep, and wake up once we land. I wake up in a blur hoping it was a bad dream, only to find that we had to exit on the tarmac. Surprisingly as I exited the same flight attendant that took my mod gave it back to me and I reluctantly took it back, saying I was going to get rid of it as soon as I got home. 
Exiting on the tarmac there were two cops waiting for me. They gave me two options, wait to see if the airline would fine me, or give them my information and they would detain me. 

I waited for a fine, and for whatever reason never got one. I got lucky, and to this day am not on any no fly list that I know of. 

Don't get drunk on a plane, and if you do, keep your vaping products away from your drunken self. 

TL;DR
Drunkenly vaped on a plane unintentionally because I forgot where I was, got my vape confiscated and landed on the tarmac where I was greeted my 2 cops  who almost detained me",19
"TIFU by taking ""you"" referring to me in a business transaction.",t2_8elumfx2,"Because of Covid and the new restrictions, the place I work has this drive-thru inspired ordering process. One door is where the orders are taken, the other serves as the pickup/outstation. 
Since it's cold, guests usually place an order and go elsewhere. So, a phone number is placed with an order, so the machine can text (that number connected to the order) once the kitchen checks it off as completed. Now, on to where I messed up.  

G is Guest
Me is My response  
[Paraphrasing will be used in the following sequence of events]. 

After placing the guest's order and number in, I went back to give his change &amp; receipt. He tipped me, I thanked him. While looking over his receipt, he goes:  

G: Are you going to text me? Or... 
Me: No, I can't! There is this thing about guests and workers, y'know... 
G: [something] my order?  
Me: Yes. For that. 

His head tilted once that was said, so I just nodded to avoid regretting more words. He didn't move or say anything after that, which caused me to take that as leave to go. 

I was walking pretty directly away from the door to let a manager know. I'm the type of worker that lets management be aware of stuff that has to do with me before someone or something else lets my actions be known, I hope that makes sense. 

The manager that was there found it more humorous than concerning thankfully! Then gave a couple of examples of how I could apologize if I was the one to give this guest their order.  
I ended up bagging his order, so I threw a couple of extra sauces in there for good measure. And when it came time to give it to him, it pretty much went with: 
 
Me: I'm sorry for what I said earlier, I didn't understand exactly what you meant.  
G: It's fine. Have a good night.
Me: Have a good night!  

Yep, that's the end of it. I told the manager that gave me advice on the matter, y'know. I didn't register what he meant partly because most guest uses the same phrase for that type of question. It's the first time, I've ever gotten a ""will you call"", it's usually"" when is the text"" or ""is it a text or call"" those type of things. I took him saying ""you"" as him addressing me instead of the business/company text he was expecting. 

TL:DR: Dude asks ""Are you going to text me?"", I said ""No..."" and started giving the rules of thumb. He was talking about his 'order ready' text. The manager gave advice, we said: ""...good night."".",16
TIFU by not looking at the gender sign on the bathroom,t2_41i4qsui,"So I’m in DC working a large corporate event. (I work in event production). It’s at a large federal building that has 2 large event rooms. Through out the setup days I’ve been using the same bathroom area. Men’s room on the left, ladies’ on the right. 

Finally we’re at event day. It’s a huge event with many presentation sessions and a few hundred people. It’s also the day I chose to have food court Mexican food. At the first break between presentations, it hits me and I rush to the closest bathroom. (Not the one I always go to). I instinctively go to the left. It’s empty (sigh of relief). I notice there aren’t any urinals but there are extra stalls. “That’s interesting” I say to myself, but quickly proceed to the stall to drop that mondo dook. 

I finish my business quickly, but as I’m about to clean up, the door opens, someone enters, and I hear the sound that can be nothing other than a woman’s heals clicking on the bathroom floor. Suddenly it all hits me. A tightening in my gut and a sudden wave of fear and confusion. I’m taking a shit in the women’s bathroom! I remain quite. No big deal. I’ll sit here quietly till she leaves and I’ll make a break for it. 

Nope.....not that easy. It’s break time and all these ladies have been holding in the free coffee for hours. More women start walking in. At some point I feel like there must be ten of them. I’m fucking trapped. I can’t leave now...too many witnesses. Now I’m starting to panic. Someone’s gonna seem my shoes under the stall, think I’m some sort of perv, and call the cops. I remind you I’m also in a government building. That’s it, I’m going to get arrested and be labeled as a sex offender for the rest of my life. 

I can hear the women getting impatient. I hear the whispers...”she’s been in there a long time; you think she’s ok?; should we call someone?”

At this point I’m sweating bullets. Panic is really starting to set in, and my stomach starts turning. Also, my boss is texting me “where the fuck are you? Get stuck in the toilet”. Buddy.. you have no idea

Just when I thought all was lost and I was gonna have to bite the bullet, the women start to leave. My heart rate starts to slow, and he adrenaline levels go down. I almost cry from the relief. As soon I think it’s clear I go straight to the door. As I’m walking out there’s a young woman about to walk in. She looks at me super confused. Maybe a little afraid that she might get assaulted. I just looked at her, smiled,  held the door and said, “it’s all yours, enjoy”. 

There’s a lesson here somewhere.

TL:DR, TIFU by accidentally taking a shit in the women's bathroom while it was filled with women and almost had a panic attack.",35
TIFU by accidentally letting my dog eat a grape.,t2_9218gb,"This is my first time posting in this sub but this just happened today and I wanted to share it.

So about 1 hour ago I was chillin on my couch eating some grapes and playing some Mario Odyssey. My dog was lying down next to me at my feet when suddenly I hear him chewing something. He usually is a picky dog so I was surprised to hear this. When I bent down to check what he was eating he immediately swallowed it. I guessed it was a grape and thought nothing of it. Then about 5 minutes later I check if dogs can eat grapes and they are VERY TOXIC especially to smaller dogs (my dog is a corgi). I immediately get concerned and call a animal hospital to see what I can do. They call me and tell me to come in immediately so they can make him vomit. After taking him to the animal hospital the total was 300$ and he is okay now.

TL;DR: I accidentally dropped a grape and my dog ate it which led to a 300$ hospital bill.",15
TIFU my life by not knowing there was a difference between EMT and paramedic,t2_qhsnu,"When I was younger, I wanted to do something impactful, something that would actually help people right there and now. I tried becoming a firefighter (lots of wild fires on the west coast) but it was almost impossible to get in.

I got a job as an analyst to pay the bills: spreadsheets, TPS reports, whatever. The entire time I still kept dreaming about doing something hands-on. I took a CPR class, volunteered with a local search&amp;rescue team, etc, but that just wasn't **enough**.

So here comes the fuckup part: this whole time, I thought EMT and paramedic was the same damn thing. (You always hear them in similar context, etc.) I remember decompressing at home after another ridiculously long pointless day at the office and doing some ""night-time revenge procrastination"" (that's a real thing, look it up) by reading up all about paramedic programs, admission requirements, etc. That was just pure fantasy because it takes 1,200-1,800 hours (basically 3 years) to become a paramedic, and I didn't have those kind of savings to take so much time off work.

So yeah... Just an hour ago, I was reading a book about basic survival skills - just your basic pop culture entertainment crap - and it mentioned that EMTs require about 80-120 hours of training. My surprised_pikachu.jpg face went on in a goddamn instant. Think ""I've made a huge mistake"" from Arrested Development.

All this time - all this fucking time - I could've gotten basic EMT certification in just a couple of months, and then joined the people who fight the good fight. At the most bottom level, sure, but it would've felt soooo rewarding. And even if that hadn't worked out, I would've known that at least I tried.

I fucked up so badly... Had I known about this year's ago, my whole life would've been different. Less soul-crushing office crap, more entry-level heroics.

When this whole plague business ends and I get my vaccine, I know what career course I'm signing up for. Until then, please touch base with your medicine-curious friends and make sure they know the difference and don't fuck up as badly as I did, eh.

TL;DR - I thought EMTs = paramedics = 3 years of study instead of 2 months. Stayed at a soul-crushing office job because of that.",29
TIFU by putting rosin in my backpack.,t2_4xvwfugl,"This happened a year or two ago. In middle school, I was in orchestra (I played the violin) and so of course, along with sheet music and my instrument, rosin was pretty necessary in my weekly school life. (And for those who don't know, rosin is used on your bow to help it grip onto the strings and not slide around as much.) One day, someone forgot their rosin and so I lent it to them. They weren't able to return it until the end of class (due to the teacher, yaknow, teaching) and by time they gave it back, I have already put my violin back and up on the shelves we kept them on. Now this is where I screwed up. Thinking it would be fine, I chucked my rosin into the depths of my backpack. This led to it getting crushed up pretty good due to the god awful heavy textbooks we had to have. Now, as you can imagine, rosin duct is pretty sticky. It coated the *entire* bottom of one of my backpack pockets. I still haven't gotten a new backpack, and no matter how hard I try the bottom always remains *slightly* sticky. It also coated my lunch box with the fine white powder, making it look like im hiding a stack in my pack. Fun times.  


Tldr: Put rosin in my backpack, leading to it getting crushed and making me look like I do drugs.",23
TIFU by drinking 7 cups worth of coffee in a day,t2_4uwuufsf,"Because I don't know about the packaging in other countries, I'd be referring to a cup of coffee as one sachet. Also I was ""sleeping"" in my grandmother's house just next to ours.


So I wasn't really looking for sleep yesterday night. I was gonna play some league but then I had to reinstall it because there was some error with the files. And because of the internet here on the Philippines, it took a long time (I really can't remember how much it took). So to pass the night, I drank a cup of coffee. Eventually it installed but it was already 5 am. And my mother wakes up at 4 and she wakes all of us by 8. And I know she'd be angry if she knew I was awake all night so I slept for like 3 hours (short of 6 hours of an average adolescent). And to stay awake because I needed to do chores, I drank 2 cups of coffee.Even with the amount of coffee in my system, I slept from 9 to 11 just before lunch (my mother woke me up).

 Fast forward to 3. I was really hungry and was looking for something to eat. I was used to baking my own merienda but my dumb self thought it would be good to make not just one type of ""frappe"" but two. And I had two glasses each. I even made a caramel sauce for each. Anyways my younger brother wanted to play with me so I did. Until I realized I was easily running out of breath. I blamed it on my lack of sleep. Then I watched a video explaining why Geometry Dash was not a rhythm game. This may not seem relevant but I blamed that for my headache. I wanted to sleep but I couldn't. Then I started to vomit. And then it hit me. Caffeine overdose. After searching it up, I found out I had two out of three (the site may be wrong, it's the internet after all) - with the last one being shock. It also said that caffeine can be lethal (I may have misunderstood that) when taken in large doses. Now I'm sitting here posting this on Reddit because I think some people could help me out here, or maybe not. I'm also not the type to drink coffee. The only times I drank coffee was when I was grinding in summer and I only had one cup each day those times.

Tl;dr: I drank coffee too much and now I'm vomiting and panicking.",4
TIFU by sleeping really sweaty next to my gf,t2_9ps9pw2p,"Obligatory this happened last night, she's with me while I type this.

Last night she (27F) made me (25M) dinner after a long walk and put up a movie for us to watch. It was getting late, we were getting sleepy and she offered I could stay at her (parent´s) place for the night. With the promise of some spooning in my head, I agreed. We closed the computer after the movie was done and turned off the lights. It was the first time I was sleeping in at her parents, though we had already slept before many times, so we are really comfortable with each other. 
In the middle of the night, I abandoned the cuddling position because I was feeling really sweaty. I remember dreaming about running in an Atlantis lookalike world. I was escaping some menace and suddenly the walls of the city broke and I began drowning in a gigantic mass of water. This is where I fucked up. Still feeling really sweaty and the bed kinda humid I felt the sheets with my hands and realized it was everywhere, and not only the sheets but my underwear. Fuck. I had pissed myself.

Fortunately, she is the best so I woke her up.

""Hey, PissGf's GF, wake up. I think I just pissed myself"".

She let out a little laugh and said it was ok. We got up at five AM to change everything. Her parents were in the other room so we tried to be as silent as posible. I then dreamed of trying to get out of her place next morning only to find her mother to be really PISSED at me, cause she had somehow found out. 
I stayed the night and she woke me with breakfast on bed. When I saw her entre the room with coffe I promptly tol her that I had shat myself just for the giggles and we laughed for a while. It seems like its going to be a recurring gag... 

Tl;dr I slept at my gf's place for the first time and peed the bed in the middle of the night.",21
TIFU by expressing my feelings for my friend to her in the wrong ways.,t2_4k1n6lj8,"So unlike most stories on the stop at this actually happened about 20 minutes ago. So for context, I’m 14 and I have ADHD and I’m somewhat mentally challenged when it comes to certain things. One of these things is expressing my feelings for somebody when I like them. Apparently my ways of doing this are quite creepy in stock rush which was unknown to me because most people just excepted it anyway. Well this particular girl that I caught feelings for didn’t exactly take my methods of expressing my feelings for her too well. Basically, she became really freaked out and uncomfortable and no longer wants to be my friend. We had just started to get close, which is ironic because she went to my school last year and moved upstate after we graduated. And now it just came to a sudden halt. I am absolutely shattered and I’m basically blubbering as I’m writing since I have attachment issues.

TIFU by letting a redditor dictate my masturbation.,t2_h2d0n,"This happened two nights ago but I’m just now feeling the full effect of the fuck up. I’m generally a nasty bitch. I masturbate often and with gusto. This particular night I was in the throes of horniness when I threw out a request for male masturbation videos (my favorite). I ended up chatting with a rather kinky dude. We played quite well and at one point he asked me to put my thong inside myself. I know. But hear me out. I was horny. So I did. It was not easy. In fact, it was very difficult. But I was so deep in the game I persisted. I gently shoved a lace thong inside my vagina. In the moment it felt great and our orgasms were excellent. I guess I didn’t realize you could get rug burn inside your vagina. You can. It hurts. I feel every inch of it because it’s sore and raw. I  felt discomfort yesterday but today it hurts. Was is worth it? Yes. But next time I’ll try satin instead of lace. 

TLDR: Shoved a lace thong up my cooter at the request of a kinky redditor. It was tough and caused internal rug burn. I enjoyed every minute of it but now I’m hurting.",21
tifu by having friends help me in online viva,t2_4eurj9bq,"I'm a Sophomore studying Information Science, we had online lab exam,  where we have to type in a code and show it to the prof, after that we  have to give a viva based on the same topics which the code was based  on.

So  when the prof asked me a question, I started answering the question in a  stuttering way, then when I took a small pause, my homies thought I  need help, they all start speaking the answer, next thing I hear is prof  asking me ""who are you getting help from?"" my whole brain just gets  freezed and I continue stuttering the answer without acknowledging the  profs question.

TIFU by misjudging the display size of my camera during an MS Teams meeting (Semi-NSFW) .,t2_20i7nt0w,"First a bit of context, I have an 18+ calendar (one of those you find in a car repair shop) hanging on my closet and since the lockdown started I have been sitting in my bedroom (where my closet is) doing my school work. Most of the time I have my camera on and that is where this fuckup starts.

I am fully aware that I have this calendar in my room, but before I joined any meeting I checked whether the calendar was visible. If it was visible I would turn my laptop so it would just be out of view.

So I was doing as I described for a couple of weeks until a friend from my class messaged me with a picture...

As you would expect I get a picture of my camera with the 18+ calendar 100% clear in view. I immediately turned my camera off and thought to myself how that was even possible. Well, apparently MS Teams preview doesn't show the whole camera which I thought it did. I also interacted/spoke up a decent amount so my bedroom was seen pretty often I imagine.

I guess you could say I found out about the camera backgrounds setting the hard way (pun intended).

TL:DR; I have an 18+ poster in my bedroom and didn't realise it showed during my MS Teams meetings, most likely have shown my whole class &amp; teachers titties a bunch of times.",209
"TIFU by giving in to a panhandler at a bus station, which only escalated the situation",t2_15yfaarj,"Well this isn't nearly as interesting as most stuff on this sub, but maybe my stupidity will make you laugh or something idk.

Yesterday I took a trip to my college from last semester to retrieve my items from the dorm room since I won't be staying there anymore, meaning I'm returning with a lot of baggage (three suitcases, a duffel bag, and a backpack, to be exact)

So after a long Greyhound bus ride, I arrived at the final stop and carted my luggage inside, wary of my surroundings as those stations are notoriously sketchy.

Once inside, I began searching for a rideshare to my hotel, at which point a man approaches me and says that he desperately needs $12 to help pay for his luggage on his bus ride. Having brought many bags myself, I felt bad that he would most likely miss his ride if he couldn't bring his luggage, being a fraction of the actual ride cost.

So I gave in and since I only had $20s, he gave me $8 change for one. However, he then starts begging me for the $5 bill back to buy food, which kind of caught me off guard because I was hoping he would leave me alone after already receiving a (decently) sizeable donation from me. I was hoping that he would appreciate what I gave him and that it would help in a meaningful way without giving me a guilt trip about not giving enough.

At this point I'm conflicted as I don't want to reward straight begging, but at the same time feel terrible that this man may not even get a meal for awhile. However my mind starts to panic, and I sort of freeze up and just try to avoid talking to him despite the incessant pandering.

He eventually walks away, but when I get outside to wait for my Lyft he returns to continue pandering between compliments and various emotional pleas. He even asks things like ""is that your ride?"", assumedly to guilt trip me for having it better off than him. At times he acted quite friendly, but by this point I felt it was too late to really do anything meaningful, and the best idea was just to ignore and gtfo.

That ride was a few hours ago, so I should be sleeping for my early morning flight, but for some reason here I am up at night giving myself a mental beating for somehow managing to being both a sell-out and not good enough simultaneously.

TL:DR; Felt bad for a panhandler at a bus station, gave him money for luggage but he asked for more to cover food, followed me around until I could leave, currently feeling bad that I did both too much and not enough.",6
TIFU by feeding coyotes that I thought were my neighbor’s dogs,t2_6poheum3,"So, for context, I’m from Appalachia and coyotes are really common where I live, and they often come up to my neighborhood and just wander around. They’re not as common as they used to be since more people have moved up hear, but they’re still around a lot and you can often hear them howling and barking at night

So anyway, these two dogs behind our fence and our dogs were barking at them so I just kinda figured they belonged to one of the neighbors or something and I went outside and to the edge of our fence and I looked at them and I was like “wow! Those are two really pretty dogs!”

One of them was various shades of grey like a wolf and the other was black. Anyway, they were absolutely gorgeous. So they were barking and I thought the barking was a bit strange but I figured they were hungry or something so I went back in the house and got some leftover meatballs and gave them to the dogs. I didn’t know if they would bite me or not though so I just set them down in front of them and they ate them right up so I went back in to get them some more but my actual neighbor’s dog, a large black lab named Coby, chased them off.

But I thought he was just being territorial and that the coyotes were just dogs so I continued my quest to get them some meatballs and left them on a rock near the tree line, since their barking was coming from the woods

And I had taken pictures of them so I could post them on my neighborhood Facebook group to ask whose they were and maybe tell them what lovely doggos they had when it dawned on me.

Those were fucking coyotes.

The fuckup is relatively mild. Now I just have two hungry coyotes that probably want me to feed them more

TL;DR: I fed meatballs to some hungry coyotes because I thought they were dogs and they will probably want more in the near future",43
TIFU by accidentally outing myself to my brother and thus probably also to my homophobic mum,t2_8614hqwl,"As the title already mentions it, I accidentally outed myself some hours ago to my older brother. I (F) am bi, and I have a girlfriend. My family doesn't know anything about that and I didn't really plan to even tell them because my mother and my younger sister are deeply homophobic. i have some older siblings though, especially my older brother, we were very close since I moved out of my moms horror house at a young age. Let's call him John. So John and I have always been very close to each other and therefore discuss even a little...""weird"" topics. So like, this was about kissing and we were in a zoom call and he just started to talk about how he hasn't found a girlfriend yet and suddenly he drops ""but hey, I really like kissing girls"". And me, the stupid person I am, just answers ""yes, me too"". Obviously, my brother stops mid-sentence and stares at me who I am now sitting and seeing my life passing in front of my eyes. Because although John and I are close, John always was a ""snitch"" (yes, being 28 years old) and it's obvious he'd tell my mum. He quickly ended the call even though I was begging him not to tell mum and said he needs some time to think.
I'm scared to be honest, afraid my mother - even though I don't live at her home anymore - will do something horrible (yes she tried to attack or stalk me several times, police even got called and stuff) or my siblings, especially my younger sister (17) who is under the strong control of my homophobe mother.

This happened about 20 minutes ago and I am still all shades of red. 

I am in back-to-back-to-back meetings all week, so I typically multitask and fire off emails, update documents and take notes all at the same time. 

Today I'm in a meeting that I don't need to be in, purely to capture ""actions"" from the meeting. I think to myself ""great! I can catch up on the 30 emails that rolled in over lunch!"" I'm getting emails answered, I'm capturing those actions, all is going well, I'm feeling great and productive. 

My office is in the livingroom, which is directly connected to the kitchen. My sister's boyfriend politely sneaks into the kitchen and whispers ""am I okay to make coffee?""

I respond, turning in my chair,  ""go ahead! I'm not on video and I'm always on mute!""

Returning to face my laptop, I add far louder than I needed to ""I'm supposed to take notes but I'm only half listening!""

Silence.

TIFU by accidently almost poisoning my family and friends.,t2_2jwy27b7,"So as some pretext I (16m) have just started making mead as a hobby. I have always wanted to brew and ferment so I took quarantine as the time to start. I would like to note that it is 100% legal and very safe (besides this one goof) and sanitized.

But to the story, for several weeks I have been preparing and gathering ingredients for a lovely pomegranate mead which has led me on a chase for finding dried rose petals, dried elder berries, fresh yarrow, fresh dandelion, and lastly fresh violet. It was a hassle to get all these ingredients since they are uncommon and I can't have a lot of fresh goods shipped since they would no longer be fresh but lucky for me I was able to find some violets at a gardening store and took them home and cared for them a few days before my brewing was to begin.

Now you may or may not know this, but I did not know that *most* violets are edible, but African violets, the ones I just happened to get, are actually toxic, my recipe failed to mention that I should avoid the most common violet which happens to be toxic so I just picked the only one they had. 

Now not knowing of the silent purple killer in house I began gearing up for my brewing, I went through, put all the ingredients processed and in, it came together perfectly and I even sampled a bit before putting my soon to be active yeast in. Now I was happy with my brew and put it in my room before going off to water polo practice. 

Now by the time I returned my yeast babies had started doing their job and fermenting and as I looked away from my beautiful soon to be mead, I saw my violet plant sitting there in the corner, and it hit me. I completely forgot to add the violet, I shrugged my shoulders as it wouldn't greatly alter the recipe and went to bed.

Many hours later my mind was still thinking about the violets when I got a weird feeling, so for some reason I googled if AFRICAN violets were edible, not just regular violets. And low and behold google told me that they are quite toxic and I don't even know what emotion I felt realizing I had FU by forgetting to add the violets, but that had actually been the FU that prevented my family and friends from getting some degree of poisoning.

TIFU by tying my waistband around my pants two times (I DIDN’T BREAK R4!),t2_8zk5cp2c,"TIFU by tying my waistband around my pants. I’ve always had a really skinny waist, and it’s impossible for me to find semi-comfortable pants that won’t just fall down, so I had the *genius* idea to wrap the waistband around my stomach. Twice. And then I tied it in the back. 

Note: it worked really great for most of the day. I went to work and didn’t have to worry about London britches falling down for the world to behold, and same went for school, all the way up until I got home.. then 6 o’clock rolled around and I thought “hmm I’ve gotta take a pιss” so I went upstairs and tried to untie the knot. No dice. I struggled for about 15 minutes until I realized it wasn’t gonna work.

This was a frightening dilemma for me for a multitude of reasons. I could either cut the knot with scissors and destroy my favorite pants, pιss myself and destroy my favorite pants, or ask my mom for help. So I did what any teenager would do, I went on discord and vented to my friends about it. Naturally, being the master shitposters that they are, they send the most hilarious memes I’ve ever seen in my whole life in order to “get the job done..” in addition to this, they started moaning loudly in the vc to “balance out the color...”

I was fucked. About 20 seconds away from an accident, I ran downstairs and shouted to my mom “HELP ME TAKE MY PANTS OFF IM GONNA PEEEEE” and bent over right in front of her so she could untie the knot. I realize now, that without the proper context this sounds unbelievably wrong, but regardless of such, she helped me untie them and it was perhaps the most shameful 10 minutes of my life.

(TLDR; I tied my pants too tight and my mom had to take them off for me)

Mods, please do not remove this, I need the world to comprehend my struggles.",24
TIFU by implying to my music teacher that I had emotional trauma related to the song “Take on Me”,t2_9ks7i5m4,"Okay, so the title pretty much says it all, but hopefully after reading it you’re left with... questions. Anyways, here’s my story.

I was in my sophomore year of high school when this happened. Luckily, the teacher this happened to was a substitute, so there wasn’t any lasting embarrassment. That doesn’t mean this won’t keep me up at night.

I’m neurodivergent (severe ADHD) and I tend to hyperfixate on my own music taste, going on and on about that one part in that one song that makes sad brain produce happy chemical. Unfortunately, the opposite is true for songs I don’t like, as I tend to complain about them to whoever’s unfortunate enough to listen.

I’ve never liked the song Take on Me. It just kinda felt repetitive and annoying. Of course, this wouldn’t be as big of a problem if I didn’t have two younger siblings.

Now I love my siblings with all my heart, but they really do have a way of pissing me off. After hearing one of my tangents about how Take on Me was annoying and overplayed, they conveniently decided that was their new favorite song of all time.

And they would sing it over and over again. Before family dinners. During the chores we were forced to do together. All. The. Damn. Time.

Eventually I got tired of it and told them to stop.

Big mistake.

They would purposefully sing it loudly whenever I’d had a long day, was in a bad mood, or was annoyed about anything.

Over time, Take on Me devolved from “kinda annoying” to “if I have to hear this goddamn song one more time I’m gonna rip off my ears, boil them in holy water, and toss them off a cliff”

Fast forward to sophomore year. I’m in a school choir with about 45-50 other people. We had just gotten back from winter break, and if I wasn’t so filled with Teenage Angst I would probably be excited to see what new song we’d be learning and performing.

When my substitute teacher played the track for our new song, a chill tan down my spine.


It was fucking TAKE ON ME BY A-HA. Acapella edition.


I felt betrayed. I had finally managed to escape this song, that lived in the back of my brain like a storm cloud on the horizon of an otherwise mild sea. This song, with an unmistakable hook that had snared me like a clueless fish looking for a snack. THIS FUCKING SONG, which deceived me with the notion that it was going away for good, only to break into my home in the dead of night and slay me in my sleep.
 
Of course, I started looking for a way to get myself out of having to sing it.

I asked my choir substitute if I could get an exemption, “for personal reasons”. She offered to give me extra help on the parts I found hard, and I replied that I had an issue with the song itself and that “I have a bad memory attached to it”. She apologized profusely and allowed me a pass. I left the class feeling satisfied.

The next day, I was doing homework when my parents came into my room. “We need to talk”

*Apparently, my music teacher thought I might have some kind of trauma related to Take on Me, and called my parents because she was worried about me.*

Mortified, I had to explain the whole scenario to my parents, who were trying hard to contain their laughter.

I ended up having to sing it like everyone else. I hated it, but at least it’s over. 

I’ve had my fair share of embarrassing moments, but most of them, like the infamous Bus Incident, were funny in retrospect and I can still laugh about it with my friends. This one haunts me so much that it stays only between me, myself, and the 330 million strangers on Reddit.

ADHD is fun, y’all!


TL,DR: I hate the song Take on Me. I told my choir teacher that I couldn’t sing it because of “a personal issue” and she interpreted it as some sort of emotional trauma and called my parents to ask if I was okay.",23
TIFU by drinking a whole pot of coffee before a long run.,t2_1zadvukz,"TIFU, well actually a couple days ago, and thought someone might need to laugh at my expense.  

I ended the year, New Years Eve to be exact, with my longest run of all time: 8 miles.  I know it's not a lot for some people but it's a huge deal for me.  I felt great after, and planned to beat that on my very next run 2 days later. This is where my FU begins.

I woke up a bit sluggish and started my day with a few more cups of coffee than normal (close to a whole pot).  Once I completed the usual morning activities I began my normal warmup routine, feeling really good as I begin my goal of 8.5 Miles.

The first 3 miles are going great, I feel light on my feet and keeping a good pace.  Things begin to deteriorate quickly from here.

Mile 4:  I get that feeling in my stomach, that grumble and turn.  The coffee is beginning to rear its evil side effects.  I tell myself to forget about it and continue on, I am literally the furthest point away from my apartment at this point - what could I do?  I've never been in this predicament before.  I'm no more than 35 minutes away from home, surely it'll work itself out. 

Mile 5: It didn't work itself out.  The feeling is getting stronger, and now my overflowing bladder has joined in on the party.  This is not fun at this point, so I pick up the pace a bit and hope to get home faster.  This had an unintended side effect, my bladder is now bouncing around and the prairie dog is trying to see the light.  Not only do I have to focus on keeping pace but also insuring all of my orifices remain tightly sealed.

Mile 6:  I am now praying to whatever deity in the sky will allow me to make it to a bathroom.  I had to shorten my stride, as things are now getting dangerously close to an even bigger problem.  This is increasing my time on the road and decreasing my ability to not turn my compression shorts into a diaper.  I may or may not have had a leaky faucet situation at this point.

Mile 7: THERE IS A GROCERY STORE in sight! My bladder, stomach and sphincter are now all actively working against me and attempting to stage an early exit.  Every step towards the entrance increases the necessity to go RIGHT NOW. I must have looked like a madman with the look of pain and determination on my face and at the speed I walked the aisles. I was soaked with sweat like I was recently in a wet t-shirt contest. But finally, there it was, the porcelain goddess. There was no time for a seat cover, barely enough time to close the stall and drop my shorts.  Unholy things happened in there, I exercised the demons out of me but it felt like I had won the lottery.  I left the store with my a bounce in my step, and a weight lifted.

I went on and finished my run because I might be a shitter, but I'm not a quitter.  

TL;DR: The moral of the story - don't be a FU like me and drink too much coffee before a long run or it might turn into the emergency runs.  

Thanks for coming to my poop talk.",10
TIFU by trying to eat a handful of reese's pieces I left out on the nightstand the night before,t2_4t3veegt," 

(This was actually last night)

After putting on my winter 15, I started my every year battle in January to try to lose that weight (don't worry this won't be about my weight).....being conscious of this I decided to leave about half the bag of reese's pieces on my night stand for the next day. About to go to bed last night, I remembered my night time snack delight, grabbed the bag and a handful of chocolate peanut buttery goodness, and poured them straight into my mouth and began to chew only to be met with what can only be described as pure acid fire. Of course I immediately spit out the duracell juice to see probably about 100 tiny ants running around on my bed (I forgot about the ants that had just started to show up in our room and they told their friends about my treat. Lesson learned don't leave food on the night stand, and don't consume food before looking at it.

TL;DR: left a bag of reese's pieces out and ended up trying to eat a handful of ants.",32
TIFU By Not Reading The Instructions of a Paper Due Tomorrow...,t2_25s2ctwt,"TIFU because I realized this just now.

The first week back to school this year, I have been drowning in homework and papers and tests all due before tomorrow (January 8th). And that’s not even including Finals Next week. This is fun.

Well I was going through the homework and decided I should work on one of my papers before I go to bed and decided to look at the instructions which I hadn’t yet read.

 Instead of being an easy one page paper on a subject, it ended up being a several page paper with questions that correlate with a book that I haven’t even read yet, and it’s due tomorrow with no time to finish the book or answer the questions in time. What a great day.

TLDR; Decided to read the instructions of an easy paper due tomorrow, and it turns out it was not easy.",14
TIFU by eating body lotion,t2_7enwr1pw,"The title says it all but here's why

This is definitely more of an amusing thing than a complete fuck up, but today I had an allergic reaction to a cat so severe that I ended up losing my sense of taste and smell. 

When my airways starting to inflame I panicked and begin to worry to that I could've contracted covid on my most recent visit to the urgent care. I started to sense that I wasn't smelling any more and immediately ran into my room to smell my most fragrant body lotions. They're unmistakably smelly and I couldn't smell them. 

So enter covid panic, immediately I thought ""oh shit can I taste?"" And in an effort to ingest the most tasting thing possible I immediately put the lotion into my mouth and to my surprise I couldn't taste it.

Fortunately approximately 20min later while preparing to schedule a covid test I began to smell the lotion I had tried to ingest that apparently was still on the skin by my mouth. 

So relieved 😂

TIFU by screenshotting my friends texts between her and i and sending her the screenshot,t2_i73wcm3,"I’m such an idiot. This happened like 30 minutes ago. My (f19) friend (f19) owes me quite a bit of money ($840) but she hasn’t had a job so it’s been a whole thing. She used to be my roommate but I kicked her out due to her lack of contributions. She was bitchy (which is understandable) at first but, after a while, she understood why I kicked her out. 

That bring us to today. I texted her and asked her if 3 weeks after she starts her new job, could she give me a payment of $200 because i know it would be hard to pay everything at once. She texts back a while later, “$200 for what”. I got super frustrated because she knows she owes me money and I had already been salty because she lost my $110 pool/mail key and tried to deny it at first, but that’s a whole other story. So I screenshotted the conversation. I meant to send the screenshot to my boyfriend and say “$200 fOr wHaT” to rant to him, but I SENT THE SCREENSHOT TO HER AND THE “$200 fOr wHaT” TO HER. I instantly realized my mistake, apologized profusely and now I feel like a MAJOR dick but she’s not mad and we joked about it so it’s all good. 

TL/DR: I sent my friend a screenshot of our own conversation and ranted about her to... her.",11
TIFU by opening porn at school,t2_3cyehzy1,"So this happened when I was in the 8th grade (middles school) and I was in the office at my school because I would deliver mail to classrooms like early release notes or messages and all sorts of stuff like that and I had it pretty chill because mine was at the very end of the day so we didn’t get much stuff most days (except for Friday’s where I would deliver notes for kids to get food from the school myself included) so I was sitting at this little table scrolling through my phone because I had no schoolwork or anything to do and I went onto safari to clear my history since I didn’t think anyone was around and so I went to clear it and I heard footsteps so I was like “oh shit I need to hide this so they don’t see the porn” and I fumbled with my phone a bit and put it down on the table and smiled at the nurse who I was good friends with because I had recently fractured my wrist and she gave me this awkward smile and I saw her eyes look at the table and then away quickly as she walked and I had this bad feeling that I should look at my phone and right there on the table face up was just pornhub right on the main page porn ads porn in general and my face went red and I quickly closed the tabs turned off my phone and slammed my head down at the table and just sat there embarrassed until the bell rang about 5-10 minutes later and I just hurried out without saying anything and just screamed in my head “you fucking dumbass” and then we acted like it never happened.

TIFU when I accidentally got too high,t2_8gx471xf,"Background: I don’t smoke that often.

And when I do, it’s only after I’ve been drinking. Apparently I CANNOT smoke when I’m sober. Or maybe I just shouldn’t smoke at 9pm the night before a big interview. I’m gonna go with the latter lol.

I smoke with a friend and 10 minutes later I think to myself, “This is it, this is how I die”. I excuse myself as cool (definitely awkwardly) as possible and go sit in my car. I’m wondering if I can drive home (question mark?). Like, can you be too high to drive? I think to myself, “I’m just being paranoid, I’ll try pulling out of the driveway to see if I’m OK.” 

[Do you ever see tv shows where they show a person smoking and they start hallucinating? You’re like, “yeah ok, that doesn’t happen”. I’m still only 97% sure I didn’t hallucinate what happened next.]

I pull out and suddenly giant fireworks are exploding everywhere. Hoards of people on bikes with flashing lights appear out of thin air. They’re cheering and waving at me in my car. I am mortified.

Who were they? Crazy Trump supporters storming in the street? A hallucination? Whatever it was, big NOPE to driving home. I feel like a fell down the rabbit hole, was this real life??? I pull back in my previous spot and get out to take a walk, hoping I could walk off this “too-high panic attack”. I walk for 15 minutes before realizing I’m shaking violently. “This is it, I’m going to have a seizure or something” ....then I realize it’s freezing out and I’ve been walking around in athletic wear. I’m dumb.

So I call a Lyft (always good decision!) and wait. It had now been like 10 minutes with the app still searching for a driver, and I’m now freezing (OH by the way, heater doesn’t work in my car) and I’m still convinced I’m about to die. I sit in front of a tree, wondering if this is going to be the end. Then my Lyft app pings:

“JESUS is coming”.

I can’t help but start laughing hysterically. What a fitting end to a stupid self-caused experience. Happy 2021. 

TLDR; got too high, maybe hallucinated Trump supporters (???), then got saved by Jesus (I gave him 5 stars and a 50% tip).

TIFU by being vegan and possibly giving my family botulism,t2_elym0,"I  am vegan. My husband is not. For New Year’s Eve we ordered a giant box  of Mediterranean food that was mostly vegan with a few non-vegan sauces  for the husband. Last night, I was looking to use up the last of the  nonvegan garlic sauce. Since it's only a few days old I figured it had  to be fine and mixed it into my husband’s portion of spaghetti.

As  hubby takes his plate to the TV to eat I hear him in the other room  going, “Oh god! Oh god!” I think, damn, he really likes it. Until he  marches back into the kitchen announcing that it was bad, off, no good.  “It tastes like chemicals!” he says. I take a bite off his plate,  because that’s what people do when something is bad. The militant vegans  will probably be here soon to tell me that this single action probably  took out a big section of the Amazon and killed the last forest fairy  but anyway. I still think it’s fine but except for these stolen bites  I’ve been vegan for a long time, so maybe I can’t tell anymore. We dump  his plate, throw out the rest of the sauce, feed him off of my portion  of dinner, and resolve to have ice cream later to make it up.

Except  something is nagging me. After I finish my dinner I go back to  the  garbage can and pull the sauce out. It’s kinda...bubbly. I can jellies  and vegetables sometimes and start freaking out: *oh my god I just ate botulism.*  I call out for husband. My vision is greying. I am having a panic  attack. We live in an urban area, hospitals are at capacity with COVID,  and *I just gave us botulism.*

Husband  tells me to calm down as I'm taking off my sweater and pants to get  maximum airflow on this rolling ball of overheating anxiety attack.  Botulism doesn’t taste bad, he says. I challenge him to show me where an  authority says that something that tastes bad can’t coexist with  botulism. I decide while he’s doing that I’m going to return to the arms  of my teenage fling with bulimia.

After  I’m done horking up enough mangled spaghetti and bread to convince  myself that that cursed stolen spoonful of botulism must have come out  too, I clean up and rejoin my husband. He says, show me this sauce. So  we go to the fridge, in which I’ve wrapped up the remaining sauce in  order for the  CDC to test it for botulinum when I am in the hospital  with paralyzed vocal cords. My husband examines it, prods it, and  suddenly sticks his finger in it to taste it before I can stop him.  “Huh,” he says. “That tastes good,"" he announces. “Something else must  have tasted funny! You’ll be fine!” Husband comes in for a kiss.

I  stop him from all that. Not only am I relatively fresh from a 10 minute  fling with the toilet but he’s somehow got stuff all over his wildman  COVID beard. It looks like...clear butter?

Husband stops in his tracks. “Oh my god,"" he says. ""I ate hand sanitizer.”

Um what.

You  see, he had to go physically to work today, which fortunately is rare,  and while continually sanitizing his hands, was somehow also managing to  sanitize his beard, with globs and globs of hand sanitizer. Now, my  husband is not a gracious eater. Apparently, he combed his fork of  spaghetti through the hand sanitizer. The spaghetti was just along for  the ride.

And yet: I feel like *crap*  today. Is my digestion messed up from the animal products in that  cursed bite of garlic sauce? Is my system upset at throwing up last  night (like...a lot)? Do I have COVID? Do I have botulism? **Who knows.** Welcome to 2021, spin the wheel and claim your prize.

If  my Reddit account goes unusually quiet, assume I’m paralyzed from  botulism after all I guess. My husband may just have to go on through  this cruel world eating hand sanitizer without me.

TL;DR : I am a vegan who can't tell if animal-based food is safe to eat, and my husband is a caveman who thinks hand sanitizer is edible.",18297
TIFU by almost poisoning myself.,t2_r7lfp,"So my part in this happened Monday but my Mum added to this today.

Info: I am allergic to oranges (be it man made or natural) in which it messes my stomach up and since it was discovered I try to avoid at all costs as anyone would do with an allergy.

On Sunday whilst at aldi I was grabbing my usual bottles of smoothie when I noticed a new one in the mix and quickly scanned the label before purchasing. Monday was my first day back at work after Christmas holidays so decided I would try the new one and plonked it down on the table next to me whilst I got myself comfy and looked at my youtube subscriptions. As soon as I looked up to grab the bottom I noticed immediately the ingredient 'orange juice ' on the side of the bottle where it lists all the fruit. Had the bottle been facing a different direction things could of been a lot worse.

Now here is how my Mum FU as this morning she asked if there was anything I wanted from shopping and I replied another smoothie and she basically got full of herself saying how she checks the bottles before getting them but still got me one. During my lunch break (working from home) I noticed the bottle in the fridge and without even looking at the ingredient list I immediately recognised it as one I could not have. I then asked my Mum if she did check the label and she said yes and I replied with ""why did you get me one with orange in then?"".

So yeah not only did I nearly poison myself but my Mum did too.

TLDR: have allergy to orange and accidently bought a smoothie containing it and when asked Mum to buy me another one in weekly shop she accidently bought one with orange in as well.",61
TIFU by accidentally disclosing a coworkers person life situation to almost all of our other coworkers,t2_dn8kj,"So, I have a coworker who's 2020 was above-average terrible. His family dealt with accidents, disease, death, divorce, etc one right after another. I think he was away from work more often than he was there this year.

I had started to learn some of the systems he worked on, and while I didn't get much more than an introduction, I knew more than anyone else so with him being gone so much, I was asked to take lead on some projects he was on. I got some test documents prepared and approved, then he came back and ran the tests. I didn't know what he was going through, and so went on working other projects and wasn't too involved in executing the test. But then, things really blew up in his life and he disappeared again. So, I only have the faintest idea of where things are and what needed to be done to wrap of the tests, but I plod ahead and occasionally can reach him to get a question answered. After a couple of months, we are just about ready to wrap things up.

Then comes today, the last day of the tests. I wake up with a headache and feeling dizzy. I get to work without much improvement, and grab the test procedure. I go in, chat with the equipment operators about how they feel concerning different steps in the test and what they remember doing, and going over what we'll need to do today to finish it. The entire operations staff is in the room for a morning meeting soon to start, and all their background chatter isn't helping me focus. One of the testers asks what's happened to the coworker. ""He was steamrolled by last year, with thing after thing going wrong, and he just needs some time to mend."" I say, trying to keep it basic and unpersonal, but make it clear generally that he's dealing with some things. We finishing planning, and I walk in a haze back to my office.

About an hour and a half later, my drugs and breakfast have kicked in and the haze has mostly cleared. An operations guy who was on the other side of the room comes in looking very serious, and asks if I have a minute. He informs me that what I said was absolutely not OK, and I have no business sharing things about this coworker. I am horrified to be informed that instead of a generic statement, I had listed several specific things he was dealing with that nobody in operations needed to hear, especially from me! I hadn't even realized that the general ""lots of stuff"" was translated into a specific list of stuff!

When the other guy realized that I hadn't been mentally all there, he said he'd handle damage control with the other operations staff, and the coworker going through the mire would be none the wiser. I wanted to apologize tk him, but the other Ops guy suggested I just drop it for. But now, I feel like I just destroyed my reputation at work and will have to spend months earning trust again.

tl;dr: in a mental haze, I accidentally listed very specific things my coworker was dealing with in a crowded room with most of the people I work with each day, destroying the reputation I've spent the last two years building.",4
TIFU by having a bath and letting the cats in,t2_4l5xak3l,"This just happened and is a very light I fucked up. Nothing dramatic but still pretty shit..

So, I'm in the UK and on furlough and bored so I decided to have a bath, have a glass of red wine, listen to a podcast and I leave the door open for my two kittens, 6 months old to wander in. 

 Just to set the seen, I'm already in the bath when I try the wine, which was a mistake as it was the single most vile red wine I've ever tasted. It was like a sugary watered down ribena, and i hate ribena.

So i was a bit annoyed but fine. AND then not even 5 minutes into my relaxing bath, I get the stench of cat shit. Not one cat had done a shit, but both of them at the same time. Now, it's a hot bath and the air is hot, mix that with hot cat shit is not the one. I felt it in my stomach honestly.

TIFU By leaving my oven on,t2_3mfjsd65,"So, this actually happened 2 nights ago, but here it is. 

Some background you should know is that I live in a pretty old house with really old appliances. That being said, My oven has no vent hood, and will warm the entire kitchen up when we use it. I even have to set the temperature to 50 degrees lower than whatever the instructions say because it isn't calibrated properly. Its a pain in the ass but we cant afford a new oven so we work around it. Above my oven sits some shelves that contain various cooking supplies. Oh, its also note worthy that it is a gas powered oven/stove.  


On with my fuck up; I decided to make some apple crisp for my husband, his brother and I, so I did. I guess I forgot to turn the oven off because at some point in the wee hours of the morning (somewhere around 2:30-3 am HOURS after I had made the crisp) my brother in law said he heard the loud sound of a glass bottle breaking.  He walked into the kitchen to inspect and saw that the heat from the oven rose into the cabinet above, where my husband had put a brand new bottle of olive oil. This oil heated up, expanded, and then made the bottle explode causing a MASSIVE mess of olive oil that was headed straight for down inside my stove and oven....where there were LIT pilot lights. If my brother in law hadn't been awake, I'm pretty sure my house would have burnt to the ground with us inside. He even said he tried to come wake us and we didn't hear a thing.

TIFU by cheating on an online exam,t2_wwbqu,"So I had an online Statistics exam, and although, I studied a lot, still had a couple fields of theory that I wasn't really sure of. 

It was an oral exam scheduled to 8 am. 
After an hour of waiting I came finally. The teacher told me that I'm required to agree to being recorded, so if any questions occur in my exam, they can revise it, and they will hold the recording for 6 months. I agreed, I don't suppose I had another choice. The teacher then used R (a statistical programming language) to generate a random number to decide which topic I get questions from. It was the 2 out of the 10 topics about Maximum Likelihood estimation. And then I instantly realised that I miss a lot of the topic, and my inner self started panicking. I didn't even know how to start, I had no idea what the first theorem was, even though I knew it, it didn't pop into my mind. 

Then, my connection to the webinar got really weak, even lost connection, so I opened the e-book for the subject which I studied from, and quickly browsed through it to get a point of what to talk about. My connection then was dropping every 30 seconds for about 10 seconds. Then suddenly the teacher asks me to share my screen. I minimize the window of the book, then started sharing my screen. As soon as I hit the Share screen button, all applications pop up that were launched, including the PDF viewer, which was the first application that was shared. I was so surprised and shocked, I started minimizing all the applications. Then the teacher told me that he can see my screen. I'm not sure if he saw the book being open, or what was in the book. I passed the exam though with the second best grade. But I'm still anxious about being caught cheating, and having it recorded. I might even get fired from university if it gets out, lol.

Tl;dr: I tried cheating on an online exam with a PDF reader then had to share my screen. Then the PDF reader was the first thing shared. I might've got recorded cheating.",13
TIFU by making the CEO of my job think I’m in a fight club.,t2_9odgsiq1,"Yesterday, I had the misfortune of getting a massive black eye, the event of which can be read about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/krh86d/tifu_by_swan_diving_into_my_roommates_head/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for the full story. Even more unfortunate than getting a huge black eye was the timing which happened to be the night before the most important presentation of my young career. 

Our story begins this morning when I woke up to find that only one of my eyes opened. A quick trip to the bathroom mirror found [this monstrosity](https://imgur.com/gallery/56mk3y1) looking back at me. After going back and forth and even asking on Reddit how I should approach the presentation given my stunning resemblance to Quasimodo, I decided that I should just own it and do my presentation without doing anything to cover my eye. So I finish getting ready for the big day and presentation then leave for work. 

The journey to work was interesting enough by itself as driving with one eye takes quite a bit of getting used to, but I manage to arrive in one piece. As I walk into the office, I’m immediately met with stares and could hear some hushed whispers among coworkers behind me as I walked by. I wasn’t long before word got passed to my boss who came to take a look at [the damage. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/fgzkad6) .  After the initial shock, he just kinda sighed and said the the CEO was “going to love looking at that for the next hour.”  So, that wasn’t a great start.

I gather my notes and computer and go to the conference room to prep for my presentation. As I’m getting the PowerPoint set up, in walks the CEO whom I’ve only ever seen in passing. There was an audible gasp when he saw my face, followed immediately by a “what the hell happened to you?”  I had decided earlier that I was just going to try to make jokes about my eye so I didn’t have to be so self conscious about it and responded that I was in a club, but I’m not supposed to talk about it, followed by a laugh. He didn’t laugh. 

I try to finish the conversation quickly as other people had started to file into the conference room and I began my presentation. Even though the first joke didn’t go well, I still tried to throw in a few jokes like “In this next slide, unlike me, you can see...” to a few polite chuckles from sympathetic coworkers. I finish the presentation and am thanked by my boss and the meeting was finished immediately after. 

A few minutes after I leave the conference room, my boss calls me into his office and tells me to shut the door. Uh oh. He begins by saying that he could see that I put a lot of work into my presentation, but he was very unimpressed with my “unprofessionalism”.  He said that he had had a conversation with the CEO who had serious concerns about me, apparently worried about a potential unsavory life outside of work and inability to be serious in a professional setting. I try to explain that I was only making jokes because I’m self conscious about my eye, but my boss refused to hear it. He told me I am getting a formal warning and that I am one more fuck up away from getting fired, before telling me to leave and go to a doctor to get my eye checked. To top off this wonderful day, the doctor told me it’ll be about a week to open my eye and about 4-6 weeks before I look normal again. Should be an interesting month. 

TL;DR: Joked that I was in a fight club at work and almost get fired.",374
TIFU UPDATE: TIFU by accidentally naming my nephew after a pokemon.,t2_zah86,"First I want to say thank you all for the support, upvotes, and awards. As a long time reddit lurker that doesn’t do a lot of post it really caught me off guard and I’m really greatful.

A lot of people asked for follow-ups, updates and such. My gf recorded my mothers reaction when we told her the story and the reddit post over the holidays. She took it well and we laughed about it. I made a 2 part tiktok video of her reaction and included some photos at the end of Baby Zacian with our xmas gift to him. (Sadly my gf stopped recording right when my mother cursed us out in a funny way) 

Below are the links to the videos. Hope ya’ll enjoy.

TIFU by having a sleep problem,t2_24bbpu7i,"I have a sleep issue and my sleep schedule is very erratic. I am always trying to fix it and sometimes I get a normal sleep schedule for a little while but inevitably my sleep gets screwed up again. Well this week my sleep schedule has been awful. Last night I knew I was gonna have to be awake early to sign for my package so I tried to go to sleep early but my sleep was too messed up and I ended up staying awake to 6 am. I thought at that point I should just stay up and get my package. I checked where my package was and it showed that it was in another city really close to me. So I thought ""its 6 am now my package will be here at least by 10 am"". I thought I could stay up another 4 hours easy. So I stayed up and took a shower and made breakfast and sat in my favorite chair drinking orange juice watching Youtube on my phone and scrolling reddit. Well at about 8 am my body decided now is the perfect time to shutdown and engage sleep mode. I slept through and missed FedEx and my delivery. I went on the site and it said they tried to deliver my package at 9:47 am. I was gutted. I have to wait another day for my package now. On the bright side I found another strategy to try and fix my sleep schedule.

TL;DR I have a sleep issue and it cost me to miss a delivery I have been waiting for.",14
TIFU and let the horny demon take over,t2_mqyky,"I’d like to say thanks to the kind words and all that and I appreciate all the messages 

A quick update: a little over 24hrs later I haven’t heard anything so it seems and I’m hoping what most people have been saying is the case here, person just moved on to the next attempt 


This happened less than an hour ago and I hope it’s not against the rules here because I think it’s hilarious 

Being the lonely sack of shit that I am, every few months I download and try out a few dating apps. This time around I was trying out OkCupid again and this time it’s been going better than ever. So this morning I wake up to a message, which is 100% new to me so I was a bit eager to make the most of it. We were talking and everything seemed normal and there was a suggestion to take things to the hangouts app to talk there. There was a suggestion to do a little fooling around virtually and against my better judgement I decided to go along with it. It was awkward and I ended up being convinced to jerk off on cam, again against my better judgment but the horny demon is always trying. After a little while the video went black and I started getting messages in the chat with pictures of me in the act and she was saying she’d send it all to all of my friends and family on social media if I didn’t send her $500. She sent A LOT of messages to scare me I guess, including the names of literally all the friends and family but there was no way I was sending that money anywhere, I can deal with jokes about beating off on cam. I have no idea if she did or will send them but I’ll find out soon lmao


Tl;dr got recorded playing with my dick on cam and essentially there was an attempt to extort me",2640
TIFU by posting on a buy and sell.,t2_3i7hoidn,"Background my husband and I have been married 5 years we arent child free we just haven't had kids yet.  We talk about it from time to time but just not the right time.  

We also have a cat.  Recently our cat started over grooming.  Off to the vet he went and it came back his hip is basically gone.  He is starting to get arthritis and it is causing him pain. So get him meds. Next challenge get him to stop grooming.  He can't wear a cone because he also has growths in his nose that cause it to run all the time.  If he cant wipe his own nose it is almost fully blocked over night.  
Our solution baby cloths. 

Here is where I fucked up.  I posted on the local buy and sell looking for 0-6month cloths.  I never got any responses so didn't think anything of it.  Until I was talking to my mom.   There are now people telling everyone we are pregnant.  Including my grandma.  And my husbands boss.   

So now we are having to do damage control. Added bonus of I can't drink and have been declining alcohol for the last year due to a medical problem.  This is just adding to the suspicion and the are you sure.


Tldr-   posted on a buy and sell looking for cloths for my cat now everyone thinks I am pregnant.",8
TIFU by setting off a rooster,t2_7rrfeger,"So this is still happening as i type this.

About 10 mins ago my friend and I decided to go cycling, so while waiting for him to get ready i decided to get the bikes out of the shed and have a quick look at his chickens. He has 5 hens and a big rooster that usually sits there quietly looking out on his mini kingdom. I thought that it would be a fun idea to see what reaction the chickens would have to me playing some chicken noises from YT, and this is where the problem begins. I clicked the first video on the list which was a rooster crowing, the moment the rooster heard the video, he started crowing loudly and screaming like a 5 year old on Christmas morning. He wont stop and its loud enough to be heard from the next street over. I have googled how to get him to stop but short of wringing his neck and having him for dinner, there is no way to shut him up.

TL;DR i have woken up the entire neighbourhood by playing a rooster some chicken sounds from youtube",25
TIFU by losing Snowdrop.,t2_3rl3aaiv,"Typed this on a Phone, sorry for formatting 

My mom and dad have been separated since I was a toddler and they live three hours apart. My mom lives in upstate New York and my dad live in Long Island. I usually stay by my dad’s in the summer and I was excited because he said I can get a bird.

After a few weeks of bothering him we finally got a little parakeet with a huge cage lots of food and treats and toys. It was white and blue so we named it Snowdrop. I loved Snowdrop, usually in the summer I would stay up until dawn and sleep all day but when I got the bird I made sure I went to bet early to wake up at seven. Then I would spend the whole day together with it.

Soon though I had to go back upstate though for my half-sister’s birthday and because my cousins from Georgia were coming I had to go. And like the fool I was I decided to bring Snowdrop. I bought a little travel cage for the bird and I went upstate with it. There was food and water and toys in the cage but it was cramped so once I was upstate I made sure it got out as much as it could. 

Because my cousins were there my mom made plans for the whole week and was pissed I was spending a lot of time with the birdy so it got left in there for longer and longer and I felt bad. My dad came upstate to visit my grandma on his side so I wanted to go there and go straight home to his house but my mom said I had to go with them to Queens where my grandma on her side lived. 

There I tried to let the bird out as much as possible but for most of the day I was out hanging with my cousins. I showed them the bird but as I was but it back it freaked out and flew out the door my cousins were leaving in. I was sad all day and to make things worse it was the 4th of July so there were firework going off all night.

I posted Snowdrop onto every database I could find but I couldn’t go searching for him because the day after I was back at my dads. 

TLDR I lost my bird in the biggest city on the loudest night.

TIFU by sitting on a very fluffy blanket with my whole family while wearing a butt plug,t2_9om9q9i4,"For Christmas, my boyfriend got me a butt plug (looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/gKBiSR6) ). Tonight, I knew I was going to be left alone because it was a family movie night and I told them I wasn't feeling well. So, naturally, I went ahead and watched a youtube video about butt plugs and stuck it inside. I sent a couple of pictures to my boyfriend and while I was having a fun time, my dad knocked on the door and told me to come to join the family.

I didn't want to, but I hadn't been with them in a while. I study and live in a university halfway across the country and it was one of those rare occasions everyone (my 2 brothers and my mum and dad) were at home. And with the ""appreciating small things due to the pandemic"" mindset, I decided to go downstairs and watch a movie with them.

Our couch is really old, and we don't want people coming in and out the house fixing it with the pandemic, so we just had on this microfibre plush blanket on top of the couch. I sat in between my brothers and since the room was dark, I was 100% no one could tell I had a butt plug on. I mean, no one would be able to tell with the lights on anyway. I was immersed in the film (Singing in the Rain) and I sat very still and comfortably on one spot. The film ended, my parents to bed, and my brothers and I all stood up at the same time.

Now, you could see our butt imprints on the blankets, but you could also see a distinct mechanical non-human body part heart mark right on my butt imprint. Like it was perfectly outlined and white contrasted with the other part of the blanket. My brothers saw it because they were comparing their butt sizes on the imprints, and assumed for a second I sat on something. They started looking around to see what I was sitting on, then they realized it wasn't what I sat on, but what I had in me that was marked on the blanket.

No words were exchanged. One of them just went over, smoothed all the imprints and erased the butt marks on the blanket. They walked, silently, to their individual rooms. I am currently in my room and I feel like God did me wrong to expose me like that.

Well, it is what it is. Unlike my boyfriend who's laughing about it now, maybe I'll be able to laugh about it sometime in the future. For now, y'all can enjoy this story. It's my late Christmas gift to you all.

TLDR: Got a buttplug in, sat with my family, my buttplug made a very visible and obvious indentation on the blanket which my brothers all saw.",12169
TIFU by picking the movie to watch on Christmas,t2_np18ht,"Happened a few days ago. Be aware that there are spoilers for the movie ""Mandy"" ahead.

I was spending Christmas with my girlfriend's family, and after lunch we all sat on the living room to watch a movie. It was me, my girlfriend, my brother in law, my mother in law, and, most importantly, my father in law.

Now, my father in law is a very different person from me, a really ""rough around the edges"" kinda of guy, but I'm good at reading people and adapting so our relationship is great. For example, I know what kind of movies he likes. He likes those no-bullshit action films and I love them too, so I'm great at picking movies for us to watch. I introduced him to John Wick knowing that it would be perfect for his taste and he loved all three films. So I was pretty confident in picking the movie while we were browsing Netflix on the couch.

This brings us to Nick Cage. He is a very versatile actor and has been very memefied in the last decade, but he used to do these action and adventure films that were great for dads. I remember watching his films with my dad and having a great time. So when I saw that Netflix had this new movie with him called ""Mandy"", I suggested we watched it.

This movie is very popular in my internet bubble, I had seen a lot of people online praising it, but I knew nothing of the movie. All I knew about this movie is that it was a revenge flick and I had seen a screenshot of him covered in blood, so I thought it would be the action and murder filled movie that my father in law would love.

As soon as the opening credits started, I recognized a song from my all-time favorite band, King Crimson. This was when I knew I had fucked up.

Now, l really love this band to death, but it is a very weird and alternative prog rock band that I was sure my father in law would hate. He is a more straightforward rock kind of guy, Dire Straits style. So I knew that any movie playing King Crimson would not be of his liking.

First, the opening credits take like half an hour. My father in law complained about how long it was, went to feed the dog in the middle, and when he came back it was still going.

He starts guessing what is gonna happen. He says that Cage seems too happy, that someone is probably gonna murder his wife and he is gonna go on a killing spree for revenge.

He was right on the nose. However, it takes about two hours for this plot to kick in, which felt like two weeks. This is a very experimental movie and a slow burn. What took place next is one of the most embarrassing experiences I've ever endured.

My girlfriend falls asleep almost immediately. Then my mother in law falls asleep. My brother in law fucking gets up and goes to a room to take a nap. So it's just me and my father in law watching the movie. All I can do as the movie drags on is say, ""dude, I'm sorry, I thought the movie was gonna be different. Do you wanna stop watching it?""

""No, I wanna finish it"", is all he says, with a stern face.

At some point he just starts fast forwarding and skipping scenes. Every time he does this I ask if he wants to stop watching it. He just says, ""No, I wanna finish it"".

My mother in law wakes up in a psychedelic scene where a cult leader is giving a speech trying to fuck a girl and gets naked, and all she says is ""what the fuck is going on"".

She fell asleep again almost immediately.

At some point my sister in law, who lives righ next door, comes to check in on us. She sees that almost everyone is sleeping and asks, ""what are you guys up to?""

""I'm embarrassed because I chose a bad movie for us to watch"", I reply.

My father in law says, ""bad doesn't quite cut it"".

She leaves after watching a couple of minutes of this weird-ass movie. I'm just sitting there with my father in law feeling embarrassed all the time. At some point he starts talking to Nicolas Cage and asking ""why the fuck did you do this movie, man"". Eventually I ask if he wants to just skip to the end and we get to see some murdering. There's some chainsaw on chainsaw action that was pretty sweet.

My father in law was quite a good sport about my fuck up even tho he was clearly annoyed. He made some jokes and we had a good laugh. However, I'm not allowed to pick movies at his house anymore.

TL;DR: Choose a weird experimental movie to watch with my girlfriend's family and they did not like it.",10
TIFU by making virus in my own pc when i was coding,t2_4x7s35bb,"So i'm learning programming and game development in online courses. i made a simple project to practice what i learned so far and i named it Monika.exe (because i'm a big fan of doki doki literature club). project was very simple and it was just command to print a text and then wait for user to type something in and repeat this until end of conversion. then i made it to read user answer and print the next sentence relative to the answer given.( if user type 'hi"", she'll answer with ""hello""). **Then it happened**.

i write a some new codes to give user some more option to say and have different path to move the conversion (like if she asked ""do you like ice cream?"" user could say No or Yes or ""it's depends on flavor""). when i was done with code, i started the project but program didn't open. code didn't gave me an error It should have been right. i was confused then my pc freezed for a second. then my pc gave me ""low disk space"" on my operating system drive. i checked my drive space and i went white as ghost . my operating system drive went from 5 GB to 800 MB in only 2 seconds and it was still going. only a virus can fill this amount of space in this speed. i closed my project but it didn't stop. my drive space was in 300 MB now. so i unplugged my pc. after turning it on i checked up drive space again. it was on 900 MB and was filling up again but not on that speed (like filling 100 MB in 2 minuets)

i spend rest of my day to solve problem ( do a anti virus, deleting some catch file and some other stuff). then i send my code for two other experienced programmer and they told me whats wrong with code. i just gave too many condition  to a statement and couldn't handle it. i fixed code and it works fine. but i don't feel it's Good idea to work on Monika.exe anymore. if you played doki doki literature club then you know why (and if you don't know then go play it to find out why ;b )

TL;DR : I was practicing my programming lessens and i made a hard disk space eating virus on my pc by mistake.

TIFU by showering my father in shiny disappointment,t2_2ydac00i,"Obligatory, sorry for formatting. I am on mobile. And this actually transpired over the last few weeks.

So, to start, my father is an exceptionally angry man. How he got such an excitable woman as my mom, I do not know. As we all know, Covid stole Christmas and this year my husband and I elected not to see all the family this year and have a quiet one at home. (STOP THE SPREAD!)

About a week before Christmas, I was thinking I had to make up for our absense with my mom, because of course she was sad not to see us and her grandbaby on Christmas day. Plus, she has been taking care of my profoundly disabled uncle and dealing with my insane grandmother.

My mistake: I decided to send my mom a glitter bomb. My mother LOVES glitter. I knew it would bring a giant smile to her face to open her shiny craft herpe surprise. So not only did I send her a glitter bomb, but selected the triple glitter option for the extra joy.

It was due to be delivered on Christmas Eve but with the state of the USPS right now, this glitter bomb was delivered yesterday while my mom was at work.  I just need to mention that this was addressed specifically to her and said Merry Christmas on it. Now, NOONE EVER opens her mail. Unopened things often sit around for days before someone touches them. Yet, here I am sharing with you fine folk. 

My father opened the package. My father opened the package and had 3x the glitter rain down upon him after exploding in his face. I wish I was there to see it. As it was described by my brother, he turned purple in his rage. Left the glitter all over. Called my mom to yell at her about it. (Dont worry, she called me at 4:30 this morning saying he deserved it for being a Scrooge on Christmas and she only wishes she was there.)

I can't tell him it was me. He is going to be furious with me forever. He already told my mom he was disappointed that someone would find that funny. Alternatively, Today my father fucked up.

Tl;dr My father opened my mom's gift and got a triple glitter surprise explosion to the face.",245
TIFU by misusing the toilet at London Paddington,t2_3oq64wss,"Mandatory this wasn’t actually today - it was December of 2019. 

On that fateful day, I experienced the urge everyone dreads to experience in public. The urge to take a crap. I was at the station and didn’t think I could make it to nearby shops/pubs. So alas I paid the hefty toll of 30p to use the toilet at the station. 

After doing the business, I saw something I’ve not seen in any public toilets before - a welcome innovation. It was a spray bottle filled with water. How helpful, being given all the benefits of wet wipes! I was looking forward to a comfy clean, especially after what my behind had been put through. 

Alas, this where my day took a turn for the worse. That soothing, cool water was not water. 

It was worse. So much worse. It started with a slight warming tingle. Then about ten seconds later, my ass was on fire. Turns out it was not some new initiative for wet tissue, but in fact surface cleaner left in the cubicle. 

It took about an hour and a half to cool down, and the subsequent journey through the Underground was terribly uncomfortable. I’m still not sure why I did it. In hindsight, I have never seen a tissue wetter before or after that day. But sometimes you just do shit. And I regretted it very much.



TL;DR I tried to use a cleaning spray to wipe my arse. It hurt.",261
TIFU by throwing up at work,t2_2sx50tk3,"This literally just happened 20 minutes ago and I feel terrible

So I got to work this morning, and I felt fine, then about an hour into my shift I felt like I was going to throw up.  In the morning it’s just me and a shift lead, so after I told her I still had to stay until someone else showed up. 

Literally right after I told her, I threw up, and no I did not make it to the restroom in time. It was literally so gross, I threw up into my mask and all over my shirt, like a child would do. 

Then, I had to rinse of my mask, (thank god it was still early and there were no customers to see) and switched out my shirt for the sweatshirt I brought. I then had to wait another 20 minutes before I could go home. 
I’m at home now and ready to die of embarrassment. 


TLDR: I threw up into my mask at work today",14
"TIFU by trying LSD and loving it, but also running it for myself in the process.",t2_emfy7,"So as a kid I had some seriously fucked up nightmares. My body would wake up but my brain thought it was asleep and would use wherever I was as a setting for a nightmare. Most of them I had no memory of. Sometimes I could only remember fragments just like an actual dream.



The full on night terrors that I remember were generally the same - I would be somewhere in the house and see spiders crawling in every corner of the ceiling. I also felt them crawling on my tongue and I'm scratching my tongue to get them off. I'm terrified so I'm calling for Mum and Dad but it's these two strangers telling me everything's alright but I don't know them, where are my Mum and Dad? They say they are my Mum and Dad but they aren't so I start screaming but the spiders are still on my tongue! Somehow I'm in the bathroom so I try washing my mouth to get rid of the spiders. My hands start feeling weird and I see my fingers swelling up to the size of sausages. Meanwhile the spiders on the ceiling are getting closer.


I've had a handful of times where it would happen in the middle of the day even when I hadn't been sleeping, something would trigger in my brain and I'd feel myself slipping then BAM sausage fingers. I grew out of it. My last one was when I was about 12.


20years down the track to last weekend I took LSD and mid-trip I get an old familiar feeling, that slipping feeling, and my hands felt funny...I looked down saw my good ol' sausage fingers again! No spiders though. Hoping it stays that way for future trips.


So turns out what I pay to experience now, my brain used to be able to do for free. With my old night terrors in the front of my mind I'm worried my next trip will be a bad one revisiting my old night terrors. Great.


TLDR: I only just discovered the wonderous world of psychedelics and learned the freaky shit I used to see as a kid were hallucinations so I'm reluctant to do it again in case I see some of my more terrifying childhood hallucinations (spiders on the ceiling and in my mouth).",16
"TIFU serving enchiladas, burning myself, and potentially scarring my roommate.",t2_6bsgijs1,"I made myself some enchiladas for dinner today. Super cheesy on top, the world is garbage, treat yourself.

I got them out of the oven, got my spatula at the ready to serve. The tortilla had stuck a bit to the bottom of the dish, so I had to hack at it a bit while tightly holding the dish with an oven glove on my other hand. I finally get an enchilada free, and need to grab my plate. Since enchiladas are floppy beings, I needed to move quickly, but I don’t have the dexterity to grab the plate with the oven glove on. Thinking quickly, I stick the glove between my legs, remove my hand, and held the glove between my thighs while I grab the waiting plate and plop the enchilada onto it.

This was my fuck up. During the desperate hacking for a gloriously cheesy enchilada, the glove had made contact with some molten deliciousness. And I had just put it in between my thighs. The dish is still bubbling away guys - I was not patient. This is still oven-hot melted cheese. In a very sensitive area while I am wearing the cheapest leggings money can buy. 

It burned. Excitement for enchiladas is replaced by the shock of scalded sensitive skin. I quickly take a wide stance to drop the glove, and set the plate down. Melted cheese hangs between my thighs. 

Then my roommate walks into the kitchen. They see me. They see my weird stance. They see the splodge in my crotch area. I stare at them with panic in my eyes, while I’m pretty sure my body was in the pose one would make to impersonate a crab. They leave the kitchen again. Quickly.

I take my leggings off and soak a towel in some cool water and clench that between my thighs. I waddle upstairs like a shamed penguin. I’m now in my room scraping congealed cheese from my leggings. I’m not really hungry anymore.


TL;DR - made enchiladas, held an oven glove coated with melted cheese between my thighs, burnt myself, lost my appetite, and may never speak to my roommate again.",125
TIFU by forgetting how my couches were moved into my apartment.,t2_p1l7o,"Yada yada happened a year ago yada yada. This didn’t happen today but I don’t think it matters because there is still a lesson of stupidity to be learned. 

Sooo. Back story. I had bought a new set of couches that were set to be delivered on a Monday, so I had planned to borrow my works truck and trailer to move my old couches out over the weekend. Problem was I had forgotten that when we moved in the movers couldn’t fit the couches around the bend at the front door, so they had to bring them in through the sliding doors on the back porch.

Here in lies the first of a series of problems.. At the time the back porch was open. I had forgotten about this minor detail when they enclosed our porch with screened windows about a year prior. I measured the screens and there was no way the couches would fit through the screen openings. 

These older couches were still pretty nice and a used furniture store down the street had offered to buy them for $230. So at this point I didn’t want to get an axe and go to town on them or anything. 

So I called the apartment office and informed the woman who answered of the problem. She was kinda pissed because apparently they had sent out emails about this that I did not read. My fault. I apologized which didn’t help. She said she would call me back and when she did, she told me that I would be charged $200 for contractors to come out and disassemble the screens to remove the couches. 

Unfortunately the contractors couldn’t come until the following Wednesday and the new set was still scheduled to be delivered on Monday. Here I found out that rescheduling delivery within one business day meant a charge of $30. So I had broken even on the cost of my fuck up. I ended up saying screw it, borrowed an axe and saw and had a someone fun time destroying the old couches and taking them to the dump piece by piece. Problem resolved.

In comes the last fuck up in the series. I had not considered how the delivery company was going to get the new couches into the house. As they would not fit through the screens, as well. 

And this is how I shot myself in the foot, or more aptly feet, and was out $460.


TLDR: I forgot my couches were moved into my apt via the porch and when the complex enclosed the porches with screens had no way to get the old couches out, or new couches in, resulting in a clusterfuck of stupid issues.",6
TIFU by not looking under my mouse.,t2_4oo9wjx4,"So ye, I found this out today, but the TIFU happened over a couple of YEARS. 

So I've had this mouse for a couple years now, been good, over pretty good quality. However, I've always felt that it doesn't slide very well. Like whenever I would be playing an FPS like CS:GO or TF2, or even just trying to build quickly in Fortnite, it's always been difficult cuz the mouse wouldn't slide.

Welp today it was especially slow. Not both directions, just whenever I would try to move it to the right. I thought nothing of it and just tried to ignore it. I tried to ignore it until I rage quit TF2. I just couldn't slide properly for rocket launches. Welp, after rage quitting I looked over to my mouse and realized that it had a peice of plastic underneath it. Now personally, I like to keep my desk very clean, and I mean VERY clean. So this bothered me and I immediately tried to remove the peice of plastic, but when I tried to slide it out from under my mouse it wouldn't move. So, I then picked it up and realized it was a cover for the pads of the mouse( the part of the mouse the slides over the mouse pad). I immediately went to the other four pads, and sure enough they also still had their plastic covers. 

At least now my mouse it able to slide like ten times more easily.

TL;DR: Had a mouse for years, never realized that I never removed the plastic covers which prevented it from sliding easily.",44
TIFU by streaming my sex tapes at our family Christmas party,t2_166r9j,"Because of my Prime membership, I get unlimited cloud storage on Amazon Photos. So naturally, that’s where I store all the horrible filth I record in my spare time with random chicks I meet online.

I was at my parents house for Christmas, and they got me an Amazon Fire TV stick for streaming. I wanted to try it out, so I hooked it up to their giant 80” 4K TV in the living room which is right next to my dads desk. I logged into my account and it started downloading new firmware updates which took a while, so I let it run and decided to come back later.

I come back into the room 10 minutes later and my dad is sitting there at his desk, and directly behind him in all it’s 80” 4K glory is me and my ho ho ho.

What I didn’t know when setting it up, was the Fire TV uses photos and videos that are synced to your Amazon account to use them as a screensaver. So instead of a nice relaxing beach vista slowly pan and zooming on screen, was yours truly absolutely skull fucking some giant titted Latina wearing nipple clamps and handcuffs. Gluck glucking away at high volume like I was trying to ram a hole through the back of her head.

My dads hearing is terrible and rarely wears his hearing aids, so I have no idea if he saw it. But he’s the type of guy who even if he did see it, would never ever utter a word about it and pretend it never happened.

TL;DR use Dropbox for your sex tapes, not Amazon Photos",68
TIFU by drinking peppermint oil,t2_8mhxj7j7,"So a little bit of background info, I don’t get enough fiber in my diet (or pretty much anything else due to working most of my waking hours without much of any breaks and not having time to eat) This causes severe constipation and other complications in my digestive system. I’ve dealt with this for some time and typically take supplements, but I haven’t in a while and it caught up to me. It was roughly 4:15 this morning as I pulled into my work place with an incapacitating stomach ache that seemed to be spreading into my lower back. I sat in my truck in agony for a few minutes before deciding to look up what might help. As I was desperate for some relief I quickly skimmed through many articles on the wonderful search engine that is Google and a couple mentioned peppermint oil can be used to sooth stomach aches. What I failed to realize is that it meant peppermint oil capsules, that dissolved in your stomach. Super proud of myself for my discovery, I reached in the glove box for the peppermint oil I used to sooth some sunburn over the summer that I just never took out.

 Down the hatch.

It only took a few moments to realize I may have just accidentally killed myself and my entire mouth and throat went numb and I stopped breathing. Every time I sucked in air i felt like a menthol cigarette ready to burn out. There I sat for 5-7 minutes berating myself for dying in such a stupid way in my work parking lot when all of a sudden it stopped. I happily jumped out my truck and was disappointed when I realized my stomach was hurting.

TL;DR: Chugged some Walmart essential oils to sooth stomach ache and almost suffocated.",106
TIFU by eating a pot brownie,t2_ci9lf,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Like most TIFU it didn't happen today but on December 31, 2020 



An earlier story reminded me of my New Year's. I decided to eat pot brownie, figured I was sleeping when I went into 2020 so being stoned for 2021 probably wouldn't make it worse. My roommate ate half of a brownie a few days earlier and felt nothing so I figure I can eat the other half. I should mention he smokes 3+ times a day and I don't know the last time I smoked weed. 


Twenty minutes later I know I'm in trouble. I thought these things took an hour to kick in and I'm already stoned. We're watching Grey's Anatomy, which was ""my show"", and all I can say is how awful that show is. I was on my third or fourth rewatch of that series but all I kept saying was how awful it was. Everything looked like it was shot in portrait mode and like just so cheesy. Roommate gets mad at me because somehow sober me is all about this show, he's gotten hooked but now I'm ruining it. Eventually he notices I'm high because I have the giggles and am just saying stupid shit just to entertain myself. After a bit I have to poop. I go upstairs and I'm sitting on the toilet when suddenly I forget how to poop. I don't know how to do it. I question if I am even pooping at that moment...what does it feels like? I don't fucking know. So I decide to just sit there until it feels 'right' to start wiping because obviously my body just knows how to poop. Poop finishes, standard amount of wipes, we good.


I don't know if any of you have experienced going to the bathroom and realising how messed up you are? I just experienced that, forgot how to poop, and now I have to navigate stairs. That just ain't happening. Lucky my bedroom is right next to the toilet so I'm going to sleep it off a bit. I lay there, convincing myself that no one has ever died from eating edibles, and just decide to enjoy the ride. I'm not sure if I feel asleep or the world just skipped a beat but then I realise I have to get downstairs because I am hungry but I still don't know how to do stairs. That being said somehow I make it downstairs without falling. I probably convinced myself that if I remember how to poop I should know how to do stairs but I don't know for sure. Get some munchies and start mowing down. 


While I'm eating the food I feel like I am just sinking into the couch, actually more like melting back into the couch. So I adjust myself forward but now I'm melting in that way so I lean back. This repeats over some period of time and then I'm done. Roommate tries to tell me what to do because I'm greening out but I don't care. I need to get back to bed. I make it back to my bed and I'm laying there hating how my weighed blanket feels but also needing to be under it because it helps anxiety just tripping balls. I don't remember how I know I was ""tripping balls"", but I just do. Next thing I know fireworks are waking me up at midnight. 



TL;DR - Ate way too much brownie and went to be at 9pm New Year's Eve",28
TIFU by ignoring a debt collector.,t2_2l6s53ij,"This didn't actually happen today, but was over a long period of time. However, the consequences caught up to me today.  About a year and a half ago I had a some financial difficulties, ran up a lot of debt, and was unable to even make minimum payments.  After several failed attempts to reach an agreement a credit card company I stopped taking their calls and it eventually went to a collection agency. Since I couldn't afford any payments I ignored their calls as well.  

Fast forward to today when a member of the Sheriffs department comes to my place with a civil summons from the aforementioned collection agency.  So now I have 30 days to come up with a stupid amount of money in order to settle out of court or take my chances and try to defend myself in court.  Moral of the story: do not ignore collection agencies!

TL;DR I ignored a collection agency for a long time and now they're suing me.",105
TIFU by wathcing porn during online class and not muting the mic,t2_7uo0ytnt,"Before you say anything: no, my camera wasn't turned on.

We've been in lockdown since early November here in Hungary, and this was just another usual day, sitting through online classes, trying my best not to daydream. However, this was during German class, which I usually don't pay too much attention to, since I spend a lot of time with my extended family in Vienna, Austria, so I know a decent amount of German. But in spite of all this, the teacher sometimes still calls on me, when no one else can answer the question.

After answering one of these questions, I had the quite questionable idea to watch some porn, but I went along with this hell of an idea nonetheless. Now, I was logged in to class on my PC, but was watching porn on my phone, but I put the phone right in front of my laptop, and there was no headset plugged into the laptop, so everything happening around me can usually be heard.

After a good 5 minutes into the video, one guy let out a rather **audible** moan, which was so loud, that I'm pretty sure even my brother could hear it in the room next to mine. I quickly lowered the volume, but when I took a quick glance at my laptop screen, I noticed that after answering the question, I forgot to turn off my mic. That, combined with the sudden influx of Messenger notifications on my phone, quickly led me to the realisation:

# They heard the moan!

With shaking hands, I opened the group chat, and like 6-7 people were simultaniously asking ""did y'all hear the moan"" ""what was that moan"" and other questions like this. Scared and scarred, I typed ""tf was that"" into the group chat, muted my mic and starred at the laptop until the end of the class, questioning my life decisions. No one actually said anything during the online class, so I don't know exactly how many people have heard it, or if the teacher could hear it, but that was a uniquely interesting experience.

TL;DR.: I watched porn during online class without muting my mic and they heard the moaning.",340
TIFU by eating raw potato,t2_2s1hdvf7,"Okay, please don't judge my IQ based on this! Also: happened some years ago, then eventually caught up with me.

When I was a kid I tried out for a basketball team. I wasn't a tall kid, so I asked the coach if there was anything I could do to get taller and he told me that he used to eat raw potato everyday until he reached the hight he was comfortable with.

Since I was 9 years old I totally trusted him, so I started to eat a piece of raw potato everyday to get taller. It tasted really nasty, but I was determined to grow tall and maybe one day become one of the best basketball players in the world.

Some months goes by, and I lost all interest in basketball, so I stop eating the raw potato. For some reason my parents were in this with me, so we were measuring my growth every week, and since I was only 9, I did grow a lot taller when eating the raw potato.

At some point I just stopped eating raw potato, and I totally forgot about all of this.

Fast forward to Christmas Eve 2020 I am now 27 years old and celebrating Christmas with my SO, my soon-to-be in laws and my family. We start talking about their height, since my SO and his brothers are all 1.90m (6'3) tall or taller. For some reason I said ""haha, you guys must have eaten A LOT of raw potato as kids!"" and my mom just burst out laughing and is almost choking on her food.

December 24th 2020, at 27 years old, I learned that raw potato does not make you tall.

TL;DR: I believed raw potato would make me tall, but it didn’t, and I was today years old when I found out. Not my proudest moment.

Edit: Changed some misspelled words. Wow, I just wrote this because I couldn’t sleep and didn’t think it would get this much attention! Thanks for all the comments and awards, I will try to reply to as many as I can!

Side note: I googled that raw potato is in fact not good for you in big amounts, but I never ate a whole entire potato in one go. I just grabbed small pieces, so I didn’t get sick.",23313
TIFU by thinking I got a prank call,t2_75b68ov2,"Context: There is this girl in my class (let's call her emily) and she prank calls me nearly every day. Really annoying.

I was woken up to my phone vibrating with a call with no caller ID. The other person spoke and said ""Hello!"" And they sounded JUST LIKE EMILY. At this point I thought 'seriously Emily? I literally just woke up' and I said ""Emily, I know this is you. Stop calling me."" The other person on the like said ""Hi this is Currys PC world"" and I was thinking that she sure was persistent. ""Hi Emily"" I replied back.""I'm calling for a recent order you made of a switch a while ago?"" At this point I realized that this wasn't Emily and it was actually Currys pc world. ""Just so you know are conversation is recorded"" she said after that. The conversation played out normal afterwards. When the call ended, I was cringing and wondering how I could go to sleep after this.

TL;DR: I got a call from Currys pc world and thought it was someone and accused them of being them",9
TIFU by telling my Father I have used Marijuana Edibles in what was probably the worst way to do so.,t2_2oqzv7s2,"&gt;Tl;Dr I was doing a small beans (outdoors masks required) venue for standup and I had about thirty minutes about my [Previous Post in this Sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k5lekm/tifu_by_accidentally_eating_marijuana_edibles/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) which is a detailed story of my first time ever using marijuana. My father was in the crowd, and he was not happy. 


&gt;okay, so there I was... 

I’m on the stage, the sponsors are paying me for 2 hours, which is a fucking drag of a show, if you don’t have anything to talk about, but this is 2021, six days in (at this point) and my first show in almost exactly a year. I was probably at the peak of my “Funny”, it was a solid bout of laughs, people were coming up just to hear me, really, it was just me doing what I love to do, something I hardly ever get paid for. But the show must always come to a close, and, my final story, was [my edible nightmare ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k5lekm/tifu_by_accidentally_eating_marijuana_edibles/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

&gt;I’m in the middle of the story...

(To preface this, I was visiting my hometown, with my lovely fiancée, and we were staying at my parents’.)

I look out amongst the smiles, and there he was, 6’2, 200 pounds, and pissed the fuck off. My dad has always hated potheads, and though I never have used pot on my own volition, I knew there were talks to be had. I knew that I was about to have the lecture of my life, I’m a grown ass man, about to have my soul crushed by parental disappointment. I had to really focus to get the story out of my lips, and as I finish, say my goodbyes, and start to walk off stage, I have the butterflies of a promposal-ing teen with his balls in a Vice. 

&gt;my old man says to me 

“I’ve only ever been good to you son, and you never talk to me”

I know, I’m sorry dad

“It’s not like I’m some Dick that hates you, I’m your father for fuck’s sake”

W-w-well sometimes you’re hard to talk to (I’m noticing that he’s not angry, he’s hurt) 

-paraphrasing because it was long-

“You know, boy, I tried so hard with you. I thought that I had life alllll figured out, I thought that I knew up from down, left from right, good from bad, but then you were born and everything changed. I couldn’t be the me I was when I was your age, care free, like three bills and a car I bought for nothin’. I had to be a parent, and sometimes parents have to be harsh, sometimes you have to be the bad guy because your kid thinks the good guy is some fucking creep. I never did any of that shit, I drink, three beers a week and I go to bed at 8:30, kid, we’re not so different. But you’re the weirdest fucking guy I know, even your fiancée thinks you’re a weirdo. Only a fucking freak would keep this shit away from his own dad-

-my dad has a history of ruining a good moment-

-why would you not want me to know this? Why wouldn’t you want me to know that you were high on some bullshit dope, huh? Huh?”

Sometimes you’re hard to talk to dad

“It’s hard now because you keep secrets and then the truth comes out”

It’s not a secret, I just told a few dozen people and I plan on...

“A few dozen strangers but not your own father!?”

Well, this is my dream, dad, it’s just a funny story

“A story that makes me sound like a Dick”

Dad, you’re in it for a total of three sentences, maybe

“Still, all of these people don’t know me from job, but they know I’m an asshole”

You’re not an asshole

“Well I sound like one when you talk about me”

Well if you weren’t an asshole in the story, it wouldn’t be funny, I guess

“If I wasn’t even in it it would be funny, you just threw that part in to make me feel bad”

I didn’t even know you were coming 

“Of course you didn’t, because I’m an asshole,  right?”

I feel like we’ve been here, pop, I keep telling you you aren’t an asshole, I just have a hard time talking to you...

“Why, I’m talkin’ to you right now” 

Dad it’s been like ten minutes and all we’ve said is that you aren’t an asshole or a Dick like five times, I think the point’s been made

“See, you say I’m hard to talk to but...”

&gt;this continued for some time, I think it ended somewhere along the lines of him not being a Dick or an asshole.  

I fucked up, really, by not telling him the story, and by probably not talking to him more.",9
TIFU by not referring to a child as a king.,t2_15zz9t,"Obligatory note that this actually happened a while ago, and I'm just posting it today.

I work at a print shop.  I sit at the front desk and do graphic design by appointment, or take walk-ins if I'm not busy.   On that day a large woman came in towing three young kids, no appointment, and (with no warning) started to dictate to me what she wanted on her son's birthday invites.  While this is rude, it's not uncommon, so I let her talk, started taking notes, and we got to talking about her son's likes and interests.  He's turning 5, and the whole time, talking about his favorite Power Rangers, but his Mom was having none of that and kept asking me to use Paw Patrol.  This is fine.  I have a rather limited selection of licensed and branded artwork, but if she can't just settle for generic graphics or pay for me to make something special for her son, so be it.  We finally got art style settled, and then she starts writing down the text.  The writes the kid's name as ""Miking.""  This is where TFU happened.

Now... how would you pronounce that name?  I didn't think twice about it.  I'm pasty-white with some Nordic ancestry, so I just started talking, pronouncing it like ""viking"" but with an M.  The woman interrupts me mid-sentence, and is apparently shocked. **SHOCKED** that I would so *boldly* mispronounce her kid's name.  She then spent about 20 minutes trying (and failing) to get me to refer to her toddler as ""My King"" before giving up and leaving without purchasing the invites, leaving me to explain to the boss why she sat for 20 minutes and ended up not buying anything.  


TL;DR woman gave her child a ridiculous name essentially declaring him a King and wasted my time unable to accept or understand why I wouldn't refer to him that way.  Poor kid is probably going to have a rough go of it in school with a name like that.",55
TIFU by deep-cleansing my hair,t2_987a0zck,"It’s approximately 2:30 AM, and half an hour ago I found myself in the predicament of “I really need to sleep, I haven’t showered in a while and I feel gross and won’t be able to sleep until I shower but I procrastinated too long and now it’s the middle of the night”. 

I promise I’m not disgusting, I do shower regularly, I just have dark hair that gets greasy easily (and I swear it traps odors from around me). Because my hair’s been bothering me, I was looking up ways to deep-cleanse it, and I found some articles that suggested baking soda, or apple cider vinegar, or both. 

Naturally, I dumped some baking soda into my hair, ruffled it around, it did a really good job of absorbing the grease and actually made me think about going platinum blonde/white at some point in the future. Then, I rinsed it out with apple cider vinegar - it sounds so cool to have all the fizzy directly on your scalp, but it also hurts (shocker).

My head’s white and powdery, and also dripping with vinegar, and that’s when I realized I’d definitely need to take a shower to wash away the sins of my experiment. I turned on the shower... but nothing came out. Mild panic. Turned off the shower, went over to the sink... BUT THE SINK DIDN’T HAVE ANY WATER EITHER. 

The shower magically had water again at like 2:45 (but with really low pressure), I rinsed out the baking soda + vinegar and swore to just go buy a better shampoo. I’m taking recommendations.

tl;dr tonight I fucked up by putting baking soda and vinegar into my hair, but the shower wasn’t working and I couldn’t wash it out.",12
TIFU by thinking dish soap was butter,t2_2150kqqy,"So I’m at my parents’ house, cooking up some delicious chicken tortellini soup and garlic butter bread sticks for my mom and dad. As I stir the simmering soup, a splash hits my shirt. Shit, I really like this shirt and don’t want a stain. I change shirts and apply a little Dawn to the spot to try and remove it early before it sets. As I hang up the shirt, I realize there’s a glob of congealed greasy something on the side of my hand. My mind instantly thinks “Oh, leftover garlic butter from the breadsticks!” My hands were otherwise clean and I do love me some garlic butter, so I licked the side of my hand where the glob was.

Instant regret.

That was the hand I had just used to squish dish soap onto my shirt; there must have been some congealed, somewhat concentrated soap on the outside of the bottle. The taste of Dawn dish soap starts stinging the inside of my mouth. Oh god, I’m going to puke. I spit out has much as I can and grab a glass to fill with water to rinse my mouth. 

Instant regret x2. 

The water is warm considering i was just running hot water in the kitchen for dishes. The warm water starts causing the soap to foam. I have bubbles coming out of my mouth, foam coming out of my nose. I can even feel it expanding and trying to go down my throat and up into my sinuses. I run upstairs to the bathroom and start dry heaving into the toilet. Nothing comes out, just bubbles as if I’m one of those bubble blower toys kids have at birthday parties. I sit by the toilet crying and trying not to swallow more soap and bubbles than I already have. My throat sings. My nose stings. I feel sick. Meanwhile I hear my dad downstairs, completely oblivious to my misery ask my mom, “So, does this mean she’s not eating with us?”

I’m not hungry for garlic butter breadsticks anymore.

Tldr; dish soap may feel like butter, but it sure doesn’t taste like butter.",63
TIFU by sending my nudes to a random guy I met online even though I'm in a long term relationship.,t2_9ncv6,"I sent my nudes to a random guy I met online even though I'm in a long term relationship and I feel fucking awful.So my fiance and I have been together for almost 11 years. According to everyone we know, we're like the dream couple. We never had big fights, never cheated on each other, never even came close to breaking up at all over this last decade. Then, about 5 months ago, some things happened between us that I honestly don't want to get into because this isn't me trying to get other people to analyze my relationship, just me getting some shit off my chest. Main thing is, he hurt me. Bad. I've tried to process and heal and forgive. But this whole time I've felt so very alone after it all. Psychologically and psychically. So today I was feeling the worst I had felt since it all happened. A random guy had messaged me a couple days ago, so I decided to go ahead and reply to him. I had no intention in doing anything but talking (maybe some light flirting just because I was feeling so hurt) but eventually he asked me for pics, and I turned him down... but not for long. I wanted to hear that I wasn't repulsive like I felt. That I was still desirable. And honestly after being in a relationship for so long, the flirting and everything was... nice. 

so, yeah. I'm not justifying it, I just wanted to get it out there. 

And yes, I'm going to talk to him about it tomorrow.

TIFU by installing cheap aftermarket parts on my car.,t2_qes3x,"Back in November I bought my dream car: an Audi RS7 with low miles for a great price.  Since this is a German luxury performance car, everything for it is stupid expensive, but I knew that going in so I can't complain.  The car came with summer tires and I live in Minnesota, so winter tires are a must.  However, between COVID lockdowns and working from home, my original plan was to simply drive as little as possible this winter and get my winter wheels &amp; tires next year.  Unfortunately, the tires on my car are summer performance tires, and when it's cold out it's like rolling around on hockey pucks.  Also since I got the car I've acquired a girlfriend so I find myself driving a lot more than originally planned.  So I bite the bullet and got my winter wheels &amp; tires this week.      

So as I said before, everything on this car is stupid expensive, and that includes wheels and tires.  Combined they were $2,700, but that's not all!  See, because ""German luxury car"" each of my wheels has a tire pressure monitoring sensor installed on the inside of the wheel that tells the car what the tire pressure is.  So I needed to buy those too, but here's where I fucked up:  Instead of forking over the $680 for a set of 4 OEM sensors, I find a cheap aftermarket set of 4 on ebay for 50 bucks.  Normally I'm smart enough to know better than to cheap out *that* much, but since these sensors are pretty much standard across all Volkswagen Group cars (Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, etc.) I thought I could get away with aftermarket.

Welp, after having the sensors installed in my wheels I discovered why they were so cheap:  The signal they send to the car is so weak the car doesn't pick it up and it screams at me that the tire pressure monitoring system is malfunctioning.  I could simply ignore it, since they aren't vital for the functioning of the car, but since this is my dream car and I want it to be perfect.  So I'll be bringing my car back to the dealership Monday to have OEM sensors installed and be spending extra money on the labor for this, which I could've avoided if I didn't cheap out in the first place.

TL;DR:  Bought aftermarket parts for my car which didn't work and now have to spend extra money buying OEM parts and having those installed.",1
TIFU I fucked up while running,t2_5rbzpt64,"

So about a month ago, I went out for a long run with my 12 brother on his bike. I’m a decent runner, and I usually go for 8+ mile runs a couple times a week. I made sure to use the restroom before, drink water, and stretch before I started. I felt totally fine until around mile 4, when I started feeling a bit gassy. 

I didn’t think much of it until about the beginning of mile 6. By this point the gassy queasiness had evolved into something far worse; a volatile concoction eager to eject out of my sweaty ass. I began to pick up the pace, in a life or Shame race with my own body. 

I thought I was in the lead, until I reached mile 7 and I knew I was gonna have to make a choice between burning calories and burning a hole in my shorts. I walked another 3/4 of a mile, crossing my legs after each step in an ultimately pointless act of trying to postpone the inevitable. As I saw my apartment complex come into view, I felt a truly malicious urge move it’s way through my body.

I called out to my brother that I wasn’t gonna make it , and that he needed to go home and get my some wipes and toilet paper. He immediately understood, and peddled fast as he could home. Meanwhile, I found a bush on the side of the road, and searched for a nice secluded spot to perform my excrement exorcism.

I hid behind the bush, and luckily I was hidden from the outside world and immeasurable shame. It was dark by now, and the universe offered me some respite as it was almost impossible to see me. I then let loose the foulest, acidic, violent liquid erupt from my bowels. 

As I sat there squatting in shame with my shorts around my ankles, a toxic puddle of sadness below me, I saw my mother’s red 2004 Honda Odyssey pull over next to me. My mother got out of the car with a fresh pair of underwear and shorts, and a plastic bag, while my brother followed her out after. Silent as stomach after the ordeal, I slowly collected my dignity and Changed into the spar clothes and deposited my soiled and shamed undergarments into a bag. 

The car ride home was quiet, and I went home and took a shower and washed off the sweat and shit, but was unable to wash off the shame. We never talked about what happened ever again, and now I keep all my runs below 4 miles.

TLDR; I shat myself after running a quarter mile away from my house",20
TIFU By spraying a toilet in Europe in my shit.,t2_8r6s9mvy,"I noticed an uptick in shitting themselves stories, so I figured I'd jump in and share mine.    


This fuck up happened a little over a year ago. (Obvious TMI warning).

&amp;#x200B;

Before I go into it, I have to give a bit of backstory.  About 8 years ago I had my gallbladder removed.  I had major gallstone issues and it was that or face a medical emergency (ruptured gallbladders are no joke).  Luckily, the gallbladder isn't a required organ.  A lot of people think you have to change your diet permanently, but both my surgeon and two specialists I spoke to said it was false and nothing really changes.  For those unaware, your liver constantly produces bile which is used to break down matter in your intestines and turn it into poo.  The gallbladder collects this bile and then releases it when needed (usually after you've eaten).  Without a gallbladder, it constantly drip-feeds into your intestines.  


For the first two years, I was fine but then I started to discover a side-effect; if I fasted for too long, after eating I would IMMEDIATELY need to shit.  Like, no discussion, it's coming now.  Furthermore, it's very violent, generally wet - effectively a slightly more solid form of diarrhea; imagine mud.  I generally counter-act this getting up in the morning and eating breakfast (as you should) because if I skip it, and eat lunch, I'm running for a toilet within an hour.

So with that, onto the FU.

My partner and I took our first trip together last year to Europe.  For those unaware, a lot of toilets in Europe don't have seats.  As a North American'er, this is usual to me, but I decided my squat game was up to par, so I wasn't too worried.  We were enjoying our time in a small village when - for some reason, my intestines were like ""Hey, Toss - we're going right NOW"", regardless of the fact I had nothing to eat.  I ran for the nearest restroom, dropped pants and squatted over the toilet - or at least I thought I was.  After I finished, I stood up and turned around and saw, to my horror, that I had been bent over a little too much and rather than depositing in the bowl, I had sprayed all over the back of the toilet.  


Cue 5 minutes of me frantically wiping down the toilet (Hey, it was my mess, I wasn't just going to leave it - even used a bit of water and hand soap); my partner thought I had fallen asleep in there.  


To leave this on a positive note, I've since discovered probiotics and after a few months, while I still have the urge, I find it's more of a ""Hey, no rush but we should take a shit"" - also, things are far more... solid.  


TLDR: Went to squat over a seatless toilet to take a shit, didn't squat far enough and sprayed the toilet in feces.  Then cleaned it up.",19
TIFU by having morning wood,t2_7hukoide,"So this was way back in them good ole high school days. I was actually in 1st period world geography. So I was dozing off, and ended up in full blown nap mode. 

So time goes by, I'm sleeping so damn good. And next thing I know I hear my name being called by my teacher (who obviously knows I'm sleeping) asking me to come to the front of the class and take the overhead projector to a different class room. 

At this point I realize I'm in quite the pickle. I notice my wood. And it's raging. Like seriously it had some blood flow to it.  The whole class is staring, so no swift positioning my stuff.  So with the class watching me, I awkwardly take off my hoodie (still seated), ball up my hoodie then set it in my lap, and walk to the front of the class holding my hoodie on my groin area acting as natural as possible. Emphasis on ""as possible"".  Grab the projector with one arm and held the hoodie with the other. It is pretty difficult to walk right with an ill positioned boner. Lost the wood pretty quick probably when I got into the hallway. 


TL;DR
Fell asleep in class, developed raging morning wood and got called to the front of the class and awkwardly tried to hide it.",124
TIFU by betting a million on my daughter,t2_9j31nazs,"Today my daughter and I discussed college and university during family dinner, and she was asking what would happen if she didn't get into a top college. My oldest daughter (19) got a few B's during high school, which is what my wife and I believed to be the reason why she didn't get into her dream schools. We are extremely adamant that my youngest daughter (15) gets into a top 20 school and she has been following our expectations to get in. She has been working extremely hard since she’s in honors and AP classes, but she felt like getting just all A's and a 1550 on the SAT may not be enough, but my wife and I assured her that they are. She still had her doubts, which is why I told her I would give her a million dollars if she didn’t get into a top 35 school with just these grades and even told her I would give it to her in writing. Be honest, how likely am I to lose a million dollars?

TL;DR: I told my daughter that if she got all A's during high school and a 1550 or higher on the SAT, she is guaranteed into a top 35 national university in the U.S, but she didn't believe me, so I told her that I would give her a million dollars if she didn't.",0
TIFU by accidentally attempting a car-jacking.,t2_emxbr,"So, this happened earlier today.

I had a dentist appointment and wasn't sure if I was going to be hurting or not afterwards so decided to catch a Lyft rather than drive myself.

I scheduled the pickup, got ready  and went outside to wait. I was expecting a black Kia.

After a few minutes, a black Kia pulls up, literally stops 2 feet in front of me. I wave to the driver, walk around to the passenger side, and pull on the door handle.

It's locked.

I look up and the driver (a lady) is *absolutely astonished* and staring at me.

Keep in mind, I'm 6'3"" and wearing a mask.

She steps out of the car and from the other side just exclaims ""can I help you???""

I ask if her name is (whatever the drivers name was) and if she's my uber driver. She says no and my heart just sinks.

I start hurriedly trying to explain, apologizing profusely - ""oh my god I'm so sorry!"", ""I was expecting an Uber in a Kia!"", etc.

I show her my phone and she points out her car looks *nothing* like the picture of the car. I just looked at the nameplate on the grill and didn't really pay attention to the model.

We both start laughing and, 30 seconds later my actual ride pulls up, so at least I got a little bit of vindication.

Tl;Dr- tried to get into a strangers car thinking it was my Lyft driver and scared some poor lady.

Edit: turns put the lady is my new neighbor. So...that's fun.",21
TIFU by forgetting to wash my hands,t2_5f2ntoo0,"Earlier today I went to the grocery store, I was out of hot sauce and decided I wanted some to dip grilled cheese in.  I head over to the aisle, and find a special hot sauce which is made from peppers that are 1,500,000 scoville units.  I thought why not, what’s the harm.  

I get back home and open it up and dip some on my finger and take a taste.  It wasn’t that bad for me, did t really like the taste but the spice was good.  

After this I decide to go to the bathroom.  Bad choice.  I walk over to the urinal and pull my boys out and get to work.  

A couple minutes go by and my boys start to feel a bit uneasy with themselves, and I can’t figure out what’s going wrong.  I start googling random things and then it hits me, I smeared hot sauce all over my balls.

Damn I’m stupid.

Tl;dr

I poured some hot sauce on my fingers and tasted it, then went to the bathroom and now am in eternal pain.",17
TIFU accidentally accused player of cheating,t2_3wv4ihu3,"I have a regular dungeons and dragons (dnd) campaign on Saturdays and we had an extra session today. All of us except one player and the dm use roll20 for speed and ease of rolling. That one player has massive luck and *very* rarely rolls below a 10 and almost never on important rolls. So it's a running joke that his dice are weighted. Therein lies an important difference in wording; just means that in manufacturing process there are defects that lead dice to roll certain numbers more often. Some are more imperfect than others, leading to permanent dice jails or favored dice sets.
That brings us to today when we had a high-stress mission to save the kidnapped queen. And he kept rolling extremely high (rolled below a 10 once or twice and those were for funzies). Another player, who dm's for him in another campaign, made the half-joking comment about *loaded* dice (intentionally either lying about the result or using other means to influence the roll). Lucky player immediately says well fuck you. Thinking it's the stress, I say well we have established one set is probably loaded (still missing the wording difference) - a while ago we figured out one set was a bit more weighted than normal but I don't think he uses that one anymore.
Aand that's when we realize we messed up. Player gets really pissed thinking we're accusing him of cheating and rolls on roll20 for a while before habit lead him to switching back. Felt bad the rest of the session but wasn't sure how to address it.
Tl;dr used wrong word for dice imperfections, accidentally accused player of cheating",10
Tifu by skimming Google and then burning my eyes.,t2_mvcw0,"So this didn't happen today but 6 months ago, after a very busy day at work. I was very tired after a long shift at work, and after I sat in a park till after midnight smoking with some coworkers. 

Anyway I get home just wanting to go to sleep, and for context I wore contact lenses then, so I had to take them out before going to sleep. Unluckily for me, I had ran out of my regular contact lense solution and had no spares for the next day. I look around in boxes and find a bottle that says 'hydrogen peroxide solution - for contact lenses'. 

Now, I'm not an obvious idiot. But get to know me and you know I ready am one. I know hydrogen peroxide is bad, but it's for contact lenses, which is good right? At this point I just want to sleep and end the mind games, so I do a quick Google of hydrogen peroxide and it's safety in eyes, and it seems good to me. So I went with it. I fill the solution up in the case and take them out the for the next day.

Next day, I wake up a little later. Not too late, so I'm just on auto pilot. When I get to my contacts my eye started hurting, like it was being rejected by my body. When I finally do get it out, I think it's obviously some piece of lint I got caught on the lens. So I wash it out with more of the solution I found.

At this point I'm rushing, I've spent far too long on this and I need to get to work. So I douse both lenses in the solution I found figuring it's a full bottles anyway. The fire that came from this fuck up is definitely 10-15th in the most pain I've felt maybe. I thought I've had worse, they'll just settle in like they always do. 

A few minutes go by and I keep thinking to myself, it's not worth it. Both of my eyes burned with fires of hell as I start flapping about trying to get Satan's toenail clippings out of my eyes. I decided I didn't need to see today, because that isn't worth it. 

On my bus ride to work I had another quick Google and saw you need some kind of neutralising agent or something to not make it hurt. Not too sure, I didn't read it. This experience is also a reason I wear glasses again. 


TLDR: i mixed up hydrogen peroxide solution with ready to use saline solution and burned my eyes with soaked contact lenses...

TIFU by blowing on my neighbours croch,t2_56dbad40,"TIFU by blowing on my neighbors croch. This just happened and I still can't believe it!
Backdround:  today I was at the doctors because I hurt my eye and he told me that I must try to avoid direct light. I have been going around with a baseball cap and sunglasses all day and mind you I live in a country that has no sunlight it winter. I look like a mentally unstable person walking around like that on a snowy dark evening (I did it because streetlights hurt my eye). I live in an apartment building and when I was going home today I took the stairs and accidentally ended up on the 4th floor instead of the 3rd. I put the key in the hole to try to open the door but it's just not working! I figured maybe there is dirt in the keyhole and crouch down to try to blow the dirt out. Little do I notice that my neighbour opened the door and and is standing there in complete shook at the crazy lady blowing on his croch in sunglasses! Another thing to know is that in my county neighbors dont speak to each other! We do our best to never encounter each other on the stairs so I have actually never seen this man before! It doesn't end here! It doesn't occur to me that I ended up on the 4th floor I thought I was on the second one so  I apologise and go up one more floor. Now I'm on the 5th floor and I attempt the same thing with another neighbor. I get really frustrated with my key and thankfully realise what's happened before my other neighbor opend  his door. I don't think I've ever run down the stains as fast as today.

TIFU by not sleeping for 20+ hours before an assessment and possibly embarrassing another student,t2_12cde6,"TIFU: I'm doing my master's and yesterday we had to give presentations online. I've not really been able to sleep recently so when the assessment started I'd been up well over 20 hours.

I gave my presentation while trying to keep my eyes open and then proceeded to drift in and out of consciousness while others have there's. The lecturer was being fairly passive aggressive and rude throughout and it was kind of pissing me off as been as I know how hard people have worked on these presentations.

I wake up again just as the last presentation comes round and they picked the same paper as me. She proceeds to give an excellent presentation and the lecturer starts asking questions about it. He asks the class for their opinion on something he says and I chime in and sort of shoot him down a bit. I then realised maybe I should have let her answer first but I was literally running on fumes and he *did* open it up to the class... She says that she'd heard me say that earlier but didn't want to see like she was copying to which I said I didn't mind.

The session comes to a close and another class member sends a message in the group chat saying we all did well to which the last presenter replied not to congratulate her because she's ""dying of embarrassment"".

I can't help but feel this is due to me and I feel like a real arsehole...

TL;DR - Sort of answered someone else's assessment question and may have embarassed them in front of an entire class",10
TIFU by reading Lovecraft in an effort to fall asleep,t2_8yjuv,"I am currently dealing with the fallout of this very poor decision. 

I’ve been having some difficulty sleeping recently, but I found that if I read before bed, I usually get drowsy enough to fall asleep for an hour or two. I recently began reading *The Great Old Ones: the Complete Works of HP Lovecraft* and I’ve really been enjoying it. I heard that his work was foundational for modern horror, but up until this point, his writing had just struck me as somewhat eerie at best. Enjoyable to read, just not as spooky as I thought they’d be.

I found that some of his stories could be a little dry, or perhaps too experimental for my taste, so I looked up which story I should read next. This is the fuck up.

I look online and see a story called *The Rats in the Walls*. Sounds spooky, so I jump into it. Man, do I regret that decision. 

I am a fully grown, adult, man. I pay bills. I’m in a committed relationship. I do my own oil changes. I am also now completely covered in blankets to protect myself from the wrath of these imaginary rats. Arms are tucked in. Blanket is tucked under my feet. The works. 

Every sound and creak in my house is now the rats coming for me. Who needs sleep anyway?

TIFU by running the dishwasher.,t2_6c8k6tf,"The context; my partner and I are both currently working from home because, y'know. I'm a writer and so as long as I have my laptop, a mains socket, and WiFi I'm pretty much set. My partner, on the other hand, is a secondary school teacher who is currently teaching 20+ classes a week remotely. Naturally, much of her work is everyone's least favourite set of phrases right now; ""can you hear me?"" ""I can't hear you, turn yourself off mute"" ""can you see my screen?"" and so on. 

While I'm working in the 'study' (read: spare bedroom with a desk crammed in the corner) she's taken up residence on the kitchen/dining room table, the only other desk-like area in the house. She's fine with it, except when I'm half asleep in the morning and do dumb stuff. 

Came downstairs this morning to put a pot of coffee on, like normal. I notice that neither of us remembered to put the dishwasher on the night before, so went right ahead and set it off. Fast-forward to an hour later and I get a message from her saying that her students thought she was flushing the toilet because, while her camera was off, the microphone is naturally on and the cacophonous sloshing of the dishwasher is kinda hard to ignore. 

TL;DR - I made my partner's students think she was giving them remote classes from the toilet because I ran the dishwasher while she was trying to teach.",2
TIFU by not knowing laser printer toner was powder and not ink,t2_1gcjunp8,"Happened this morning at work. 

At home, I've always had an ink printer, so it never occurred to me that laser printer toners are not infact, ink. I just assumed toner was just some fancy work for laser printer ink (its not something that would constitute as something id want to google, right? 

So this morning, my work printer gave the big no no with the red flashing light saying I cant print anything and the error said I had to change the toner waste cartridge or whatever it's called. 

Me, not knowing that the damn toner is powder, just yanked the tray out and to my dismay, when all this fine powder (not expecfed) exploded around me and the printer. 

I did step away pretty fast, so I dont think I breathed in any powder, but let's say I did make quite the colourful mess at work, including the carpet.

"TIFU by saying, “you too!”",t2_4kyb9x32,"Obligatory this happened a few years ago but it still haunts me.

After being fitted at this store by a very kind young woman, she rang me up, handed me my bag, and said, “So glad I could help. Enjoy your new bras!” 

I had turned and was walking out as the heinous words spilled out of my mouth instinctually, “Thanks, you too!” 

Such is the response to the typical, “Have a great day!” My brain thought she knew what was coming and just went into auto. I hesitated slightly and then skittered out of the shop. I’ve never been back since. I order online, to hide my shame.

TIFU by not looking at a label,t2_2rbm1xak,"For a little context, I'm a guy and I prefer to use wet wipes over regular toilet paper.

 So the other day I was sitting in my room watching breaking bad when my stomach decided to not agree with me. I went to the bathroom, sat down, and I just did my thing while scrolling reddit and checking messages. I looked behind me and reached for the bag of wipes, and I wiped. When I was washing my hands however, my ass started to burn a little. I though ""okay I probably just had one of those slightly acidic shits"" or something like that. Then it just kept getting worse, and worse, and worse. I looked back at the packaging of the wipes and saw that they were cleaning wipes... with bleach in them. I wiped my ass with bleach. I got in the shower and ripped off my pants so I could try to wash the bleach off, but I was too late for that. Instead I just had to endure the pain of a chemical burn from bleach. It sucked. You might be wondering how I mixed the wipes up right? They are both in similar packaging. Same colors, same material, same concept.

Ash and him really got along well they talked daily and personally really enjoyed eachother until back in 2019 near his birthday he learned that she committed suicide. 

R was devastated and fell into a depressive state because he didn't know how to cope but eventually he started getting a little better.

I wish i knew what to do but i just didn't know how to help him so instead of talking to him i would usually bail Saying i had plans with K he always understood which was alright i guess. 

However he texted me saying he was having a mental breakdown and crying because somebody in a server he's in joined and he showed me a screenshot and low and behold that person had the same name as Ash.

He said ""please call me OP i really need you.""  

I said ""Oof well i have plans with K so I'll cya later"" this time i actually did have plans but that's besides the point. 

He says ""please i really need you M is busy (his girlfriend) so your the last person i have left who knows how to help. 

At the time i have talked to him before and i did know how to calm him down but i snapped at him saying ""Look i get your upset but i have my own life i have K to take care of i wanna spend time with her instead of being your therapist"" and put him on mute.

Instead of taking me to ""confirm my order"" or ask for bank details, it went straight to ""your order is being prepared"" and I couldn't cancel!

TIFU by Not Muting My Mic on Discord,t2_5w3hmpof,"This happened a few weeks ago, I have been trying to get over the trauma.

My boyfriend dresses up nicely for work and when he gets off he will call me so I can watch him change This is relevant later. We're in a long distance relationship btw. This day was no different, I was hanging out on discord with some online friends and when he called I just took off my headphones so I could hear what he said, not paying attention to the fact there might be some NSFW words to soon be said. He was coming to visit in a couple of weeks and he placed a rule on me of no, ah, self care. Well, I didn't follow the rule exactly. Didn't completely break it but didn't completely follow it either. My boyfriend and I are going back and forth talking about the legitimacy of the rule breaking. At some point we settle the argument and I get back to doing homework for my classes. I have the little red dot on my discord that tells me I have unread messages in the group so I go to check them. Bear in mind my headphones are still by my side, not on my head. I look in the discord and my PFP is lighting up that says it's picking up sound from my mic. I didn't understand why it was doing that until I realized my mic was live. I also realized in that exact moment that there was a very high likely chance that the people I was in discord with HEARD EVERYTHING I SAID! I muted myself immediately and yelped and told my boyfriend. His eyes went wide and went on about how embarrassed he was for me and was laughing his ass off too. It gets worse... I didn't realize the severity of the situation until a bit later. I thought initially they would just be hearing some stuff I said to him as he was changing. I like the way he looks and all that. After the initial embarrassment I was able to calm down a little, but then I realized they possibly heard the part about the rule and such and my shame and embarrassment increased tenfold and now I want to yeet myself off a cliff and never use discord again.

TIFU by thinking wasabi was candy,t2_5z48i98x,"In my defense, I was probably around 5 or 6 at the time. Also, I have absolutely terrible memory and have almost no memories of my childhood, so the fact that this one still stuck around kind of shows how traumatic it was. Anyway, my family and I were eating at a Japanese restaurant for what must have been the first time for me because, when the food arrived, I took one look at my plate and assumed the fluffy-looking, bright green glob of paste on the side must have been candy. So, before anyone could stop me, I picked the whole thing up and plopped it in my mouth.

&amp;#x200B;

I instantly realized my mistake as my mouth and nose suddenly turned into active volcanoes. I screamed. Just straight up screamed as loud as my little lungs could. Thankfully, it was a fairly big gathering so the room we were in one of those private little rooms where you sit on the cushions on floor and I was spared the concerned looks of a restaurant full of people. Lord knows what they thought might have been happening. Also fortunately, I was so excited and eager about this fun looking candy that the waiter hadn't even left the room yet and knew to sprint away and get me a soda. And yes, he did a full heel turn and fucking bolted to the kitchen. Looking back, I'm honestly surprised he didn't knock into anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took probably about ten-fifteen minutes and two sodas before I could communicate in anything other than panicked moans and screams, but the pain eventually went away and I survived the great Wasabi Fiasco. Once I was actually able to taste again, the food was actually pretty good the way it was meant to be eaten and my family had a good laugh at my mistake. I was suspicious of wasabi for years afterwards though and I don't think I tried it again until I was in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR As a dumb kid, I thought wasabi was candy and ate a huge glob of it whole. Immediately regretted it when the obvious occurred.",17
"TIFU By Not Knowing How To Eat An Artichoke, Which Led To Me Arti-Choking",t2_2v67o8j3,"Obligitory ""this didn't happen today"" blah blah blah-

Some background: When I was 11 I was home schooled due to me being bullied and the school not doing shit, my mom was a single mother so unfortunately she couldn't take time off to stay home and teach me. Her best friend, being an absolute sweetheart, offered to teach me at her house until my mom got home from work each day.

My mom's friend (let's call her C) was the definition of ""fitness mom."" She took a literal 5k jog every morning, was on a diet, and gave her kids mostly healthy food. She was also way more religious than my mom, so things at her house were very different than things at my house were.

One day, my mom had to work late, so C offered to let me have dinner at her place until my mom showed up. I asked what we were having and she said ""artichokes."" Artichokes? The fuck is an artichoke? I didn't want to be rude, so I told her that I would like to stay for dinner. I sat at the dinner table as she finished up in the kitchen, she later came in with what looked like a bush on a plate. She and her family held hands and did their dinner prayer, while I looked at my plate with one thing on my mind, ""How the fuck am I supposed to eat this?""

Everyone began to dig in, I on the other hand was still staring at my plate. C had worked hard to make dinner, I wasn't about to just refuse to eat it. For all of you that don't know, you're supposed to eat an artichoke by picking off the leaves and scraping out the soft insides with your teeth, I on the other hand, did not bother to ask. So instead of asking how to eat this because I didn't want to be ""Rude,"" I picked off a leaf, and shoved the entire thing into my mouth.

The first thing I noticed was how hard it was to chew. Literally felt like I was trying to chew through a tire. C looked at me and smiled. ""Does it taste okay, OP?"" I didn't want to upset her so I just nodded my head. People were already almost done, and I think they noticed that I was just sitting there chewing the whole time. C looked concerned and asked me if I felt sick because I wasn't eating anything. It hit me that I needed to answer her, so I fucking SWALLOWED this whole ass artichoke leaf, and that's when I started choking. 

C ran over to me and started patting me back really hard, after about 10 seconds she hit my back hard enough so I coughed the damn thing back up. Where it proceeded to land in the center of the table, where the following conversation happened. 

C: Uhhhh, OP? 

Me: Yeah? 

C: Did- Did you try and eat the whole leaf? 

Me: ...Yeah....

Tldr: Ate an entire artichoke leaf, choked, that's it.",3578
TIFU by educating the younger generation,t2_85s9ilc,"This TIFU should actually be a TDIFU (the day I fucked up) as the actual fuck up happened a few weeks back, but the effect became apparent only today. 

My cousins and I (30 M) are really close since they live just down the road, and they’re 7, 10 and 12 respectively. 

A week before TDIFU, the oldest comes up to me and asks: “do you know any good cartoons?” 

I gladly introduce them to the joys of one punch man. They frikkin loved it. 

Cut to a week later.

They show me their favourite clips of Saitama one punching stuff (kudos to them, they love the Boros fight) on YouTube. I tell them that I know where to find more, full episodes, in chronological order, and in Japanese (which I told them was the only way to watch anime). Their eyes grew wide with excitement, as I showed them the website where they could watch at their leisure.

They went ballistic, everything they loved was on there, Beyblade, Ben 10, Adventures of Gumball, Fairly Odd Parents, the works.

The oldest then looks to me with the most amazed look, and asks how I know about this holy animated sanctum, and without thinking I tell him:” the internet is a wonderful place, you can find anything and everything you want to look at or watch! Just tell me what you want, I’ll show you!”

Do you guys see where this is going?

So the youngest says she wants to see sea otters, and I bring up the google image search.

The second wants to know more superheroes, so I take him to the Marvel wiki (he didn’t like it, too many words).

The oldest just has the most stupefied look on his face, and says that he thinks he knows how to use this “internet”.

To make sure, I coached him through, telling him about how to search effectively. I taught him about viruses and information he should never reveal on the internet. To top it off, I helped all three of them create their first email address, variations of virusgod, beybladeking, and elsaanna!

Happy days!

At this very moment, a couple of weeks have passed.

I’m at their place now, hiding outside having a smoke, dinner will be served soon.

It’s my uncle’s birthday. 

The situation is a little tense. All three of them are sulking, their devices have been taken away from them.

My dad asked, their mom says it’s because they weren’t using the devices properly.

My usually boisterous uncle is very tense for a birthday boy, and is only offering terse answers. 

I think I know what happened.

I can hear them calling for me, dinner is served. 

Thank goodness they haven’t ratted me out. 

TL:DR: taught kids the wonders of the internet and stole their childhood innocence

Update:

Out for my post dinner smoke. 

The atmosphere has loosened up, and their most memorable search histories are in, the oldest searched for variations of “Brianna naked” (he says it’s some YouTuber), the second searched for “sexy girl fighting”, and the youngest searched for “farting butt”. Paid parental controls have been installed (by me).

My tech dinosaur dad that relies on me for everything from adjusting brightness to installing apps has the same look of wonder as the oldest when the possibilities dawned on him...

TIFU by having spicy cravings.,t2_wiycu,"So this happened yesterday, but I'm still hearing about it. After work I stopped at the drug store to pick up a few necessities and was going for a Dr Pepper when something caught my eye. It was a bag of Lays Jalapeno Kettle Chips. I started craving it immediately but there was a two for sale and it was the last bag, so I grabbed that and a bag of mesquite kettle chips, my Cream Soda Dr Pepper and checked out. Having a long drive I opened the bag and  occasionally ate them as I drove home. 


When I got home I set the bag with the two bags of chips on the kitchen counter and opened the bag of Jalapeno chips and started eating them right there. If you know anything about kettle chips you know they are crunchy and loud. My wife and daughter who were on the couch at the time watching tv heard the crunch and both sprang up to get some as well. Here's the fuck up. The open bag of chips was still in the Walgreens bag so neither could see what flavor it actually was.

 My 14yo daughter took a big handful and started a chowing down. Crunch crunch crunch! But she's like me. She has a tolerance for hot spicy foods and enjoys them, so of course she had no reaction. 

My wife on the other hand... She doesn't tolerate spicy food. She sees me and our daughter eating chips though, grabs a handful for herself and pops a whole one into her mouth and crunch!  ""Dear God!"" She started hyperventilating, ""Why didn't you tell me these were Jalapeno?"" She was mad, like our daughter and I had betrayed her. My daughter and I unfortunately laughed. She did not find it funny.

TLDR: Craved spicy Jalapeno Kettle Chips and accidentally shared them with my wife who doesn't have the same tolerance for spice as myself and our daughter.",6
TIFU by choosing to dye my hair brown,t2_7d3wpxmz,"I recently got out of a severe depressive episode, and am working to build up my nonexistent confidence again. (Don’t want to dive into the details.) Since 2020 was coming to an end I wanted to dye my hair a pastel pink because it looked very pretty on Pinterest. The day comes where I go to Walmart and my mom suggests the brown hair dye she used previously. Having only 20 minutes to decide I said yes, and my mom goes to look for her stuff. I go to the pink hair dye section and just look at it with despair. My mom comes back and asks my what I’m looking at. I quickly shove the pink dye back on the shelf and my mom looks at me with disdain, repeating “what colour do you want to dye your hair?” I say brown and as we head to the cashier registers I naively feel hopeful that things will turn out well. 

My mom dyed my hair today a purplish brown but since I have dark hair it turned out to be a light brown. My friends and family say that it suits me and I feel guilty and terrible for thinking this but this isn’t what I wanted. My mom spent a good hour doing my hair and I just feel horrible for not being happy. (Luv u mum) Not because of the colour, but because I feel as if I didn’t dye my hair for myself. You see, a few months in advance, (before quarantine) I asked my friends what colour they would recommend. My friends said purple would suit me because my skin tone is pale, but my mom said brown hair typicslly suits asians. I’m not a people pleaser, at least I was in the past, but I really feel sad because I didn’t do this for myself. I know it suits me and it compliments my eyes, but maybe this fuck up wasn’t so bad because I don’t think I’m prepared for a drastic change to my appearance at the moment. At least now I’ll dye my hair blonde in a few months and later incorporate the pink in :3. I think the hair colour is cute but I definitely am having second thoughts about this, because what if people find me more attractive with darker hair?  (Aka me lol, since I’m gonna wake up, look in the mirror and go, “huh, oh yeah I have brown hair now.”) Eventually it will wash out though, and I’m in online school this month due to lockdown procedures so I’m going to use this time to become more confident in myself as a person. Happy New Year everyone. 😊

TL;DR: Dyed my hair a light brown but not for myself. Felt pressured by other’s opinions despite it turning out well.


EDIT: Thank you for an award🥺 I’m still a nub at using reddit but I appreciate it! :)",3
TIFU by answering an online job ad and losing $1600,t2_20lklfvo,"This issue has occurred over the last two weeks and started around Dec 24th, really putting a damper on the holiday. I (25F) don't know if I'm more embarrassed or angry. 

I'm in debt now, and I just don't know what to do. All of the warning signs were there and I just didn't listen to my gut. 

I've been looking for a part-time position in something relatively low-stakes that I can do remotely and pay the bills, and I thought to myself that proofreading is the way for me. It's something I'm good at, something I enjoy, and it would give me something to do while I'm looking for jobs. I noticed this guy's ad on the website Upwork, a website for freelancers I'm a member of, claiming he was an HR manager from a reputable publishing company and required a proofreader for 3 months. I only asked for $20 an hour as that was my Upwork rate, and he agreed. He said the position was 30 hours a week. 

The ""HR representative"" only wanted to talk via Skype chat and every time I tried calling on Skype instead, it wouldn't go through. (I later found out that this man does exist, so I sent him a message on LinkedIn saying that if he doesn't recognize me, someone's tarnishing his name.)

I believed it when he said I should answer an online questionnaire (typing answers into text boxes) as my interview process. I believed it when he said I got the position the very next day. I believed it when he wanted to go on with onboarding and sent me a contract that looked legit. I didn't even ask when the original job posting was removed from Upwork for violating their Terms of Service. 

I didn't even get to start ""training"" when he said that he needs to send me a cashier's check as an ""e-check"". I was thinking to myself, what the fuck does that mean? But he told me to follow the directions from the HR department email I received shortly after. I got an attachment of a picture of a check for $1700 with my name on it from some other person (another red flag I didn't question), and they told me just print it out, deposit it with mobile banking (taking a picture of the front and back of the check with my banking app) and Zelle transfer $1600 to yet another person, allegedly the ""vendor"" for my equipment I was due to receive to set up a home office. I was wondering the whole time I was doing it if this was a process I could actually do. 

Narrator: ""It wasn't.""

I am an idiot. The bank obviously didn't recognize the check as valid, debited me instead and said that because the Zelle transfer ""already went through"", there's nothing they could do. Can't cancel it and refund me. 

As an added bonus, the guy I've been talking to has now stopped responding to my messages, with me originally asking for a refund before any ""training"" could commence and him continuously telling me that he would issue a refund but doing nothing. The vendor guy who called me once now has a disconnected number. (Reverse looked up the number and it's listed to an old lady in Georgia with a different name than the first three people I've mentioned.) 

So, I was up at 2 am with -$1600 in my account, on the precipice of tears, and I posted this on a kind subreddit that sympathized with me. Only got the idea to repost here a few hours later. Throwing this out as a warning to fellow job searchers: if it's an opportunity that seems too good to be true, it is. Fuck everything. 

**TLDR**: I responded to a proofreader position that I thought would be easy, only for the sketchy representative to hire me within a day, only communicate through text on Skype, have the original position deleted online, send me a picture of the $1700 check I was supposed to deposit instead of the actual check, and convince me that I could just submit a picture of a check for mobile deposit. I was then instructed to wire transfer $1600 of the payment to another person who would allegedly send me a work laptop and printer in exchange. Obviously my bank did not recognize the pictures as legal tender and debited me for $1600 instead. Being poor, I now have nothing and feel too embarrassed by my cluelessness to call the police. 

**EDIT**: I filed an original Zelle claim through my bank shortly after I was over-drafted, and I called the bank back today to check on the claim. I told the rep everything I said here, and she added it to my claim. I guess the only thing I can do is wait, hope that overdraft fees don't tank me and eat what I have at home. The rep said the claims department would be making a decision on whether to award me my funds back within a week, so time will tell. 

**EDIT 2**: Zelle requires a name and a phone number to transfer anything. I just used the number for info. The guy who I Zelled the money to actually picked up and I told him I'd filed a bank claim and a police report to scare him. I asked him for more information about who he sends his money to, and he said he would call me back.  He hasn't. (I wish I hadn't told him about the police thing because now I lose the element of surprise.) But the ""HR rep"" on Skype messaged me shortly after. I told him not to contact me unless he can do so on video. He read my messages but didn't reply. As I mentioned, I also emailed the real HR guy for this company and said that if he doesn't recognize me, someone is using his name for fraud. 

Talked it over with my mom, she's going to help me file a police report. She also reverse looked up the Zelle guy's info using his name and number, and he has multiple criminal charges under his belt. I still feel like an idiot (when I brought out the ""check"" I tried to cash, she just said to me ""you know this is fraud, right? Why didn't you call the police?""), but I'm an idiot with a great support system.",6
TIFU by giving my friend the wrong phone number,t2_7xjsr,"**TL;DR: In 2017 I fucked up and lost a friend by giving him the wrong phone number. Only realized what happened last week.**

So to start this story I need to introduce a few characters. There's me (OP), Friend A, Friend B (all late-20s M) and my girlfriend (mid-20s F). One more key detail: my girlfriend's ex has the same first name as B. They had a rough breakup long before we met.

I've been friends with A since kindergarten. We met B in early high school and the 3 of us were a ""friend group"". We never really hung out with anyone else, just the three of us. We'd spend every day together in school and after graduating we still hung out every weekend. At one point we all had girlfriends and they'd hang out with us too, but at the time of this incident B and C were single.

A couple years post-high school, B started to feel like a third wheel in our group. Friend A and I had known each other a lot longer, had a few inside jokes, and never really hung out with B 1-on-1. It was either me and A together or all 3 of us. So B started coming around less and less over a couple months, and then we stopped seeing him all together.

I realized what was happening and made a conscious effort to be better friends with B. I talked to him more often, did more things with him 1-on-1, and simply tried to avoid any situation that made him feel excluded. This helped improve things and we were starting to hang out again.

One night in 2017, I was hanging out with Friend B to watch hockey and drink beer. He opened up to me for the first time and said that he was very happy about being included more and he was sorry about ghosting us for a while. He had a new phone and asked me to give him A's number so we could arrange for us to all hang out again soon.

This is where I fucked up. Nobody bothers to remember phone numbers any more. Besides my parents, the only numbers I know off by heart are for my girlfriend and Friend A. After a few beers, I got those two phone numbers mixed up. *I accidentally gave my girlfriend's number to B.* At some point over the next couple days, B texted my girlfriend (thinking it was A).

&gt;**Hey this is \[B\], I got a new number. We should definitely hang out some time soon. \[OP\] too.**

My girlfriend received this text out of the blue and thought it was from her ex, also named B. He had reached out a few times since we'd been dating and tried to get back with her, so this was a very strange and unwelcome message. She responded:

&gt;**No thanks. \[OP\] and I want nothing to do with you. Feel free to lose this number.**

Sounds a little harsh but not really when you know the history between my girlfriend and her ex, a guy who has tried several times to get back with her years later. She even told me about this at the time and I didn't piece it together. She said she got a text from her ex asking to hang out and I didn't question it.

I spoke to B a few more times in the coming weeks and he was clearly distant. He told me he didn't want to hang out with A and we only saw each other two or three more times before he basically cut all contact with both of us. I never heard about the text exchange from B, and obviously A never mentioned it because it wasn't him.

Fast forward 3+ years, and I'm hanging out with girlfriend going through old screenshots. She finds one of that text conversation and shows it to me. The second I see it I realize what happened. I have no idea why it clicked now and not before. That was last week, and I have since texted B and messaged him on fb but no response. I think what's done is done, and I ruined a friendship by giving out the wrong number.",19
TIFU by relapsing,t2_wwsry9t,"So, I'm living in a halfway house for drug rehab, and have been here one month.
Technically I fucked up yesterday, but I tried to post and the bot here removed said post for being too short.

Anyway, yesterday I was allowed to go out to get some much-needed winter gear. I hadn't heard from my [35M] husband [31M] since the day before, and I assumed he was out doing meth - that's his thing, along with denial.  The longer it had been, after asking people if they'd heard from him, I got more anxious. I pretty much had a panic attack after a few more hours of no info, and grabbed some keyboard cleaner and huffed like 3 cans.

I am a poly-substance abuser, and addicted to escapism. I have been doing well for 3 months, and clearly couldn't handle this unexpected stress. I know huffing is disgusting, the worst kind of high one can chase. But it has brought me to my knees harder than anything I've ever done, and for a quick qualify I have been doing DXM for 18 years and drinking heavily almost as long, among myriad other substances.

I just had to vent, as I feel like a fuckup. Thanks redditors!!

TL,DR: I relapsed, feel like an idiot, know huffing is bad.",10
TIFU by breaking my balls while parking,t2_16sf33kc,"Many posts here have an obligatory 'this didn't happen today', but this incident occured a few minutes ago.

In my country most people drive a manual, and therefore you have to pull on a handbrake after you park. So after I parked at my spot like everyday, I grabbed my phone and then tried to pull up the handbrake. Note that this is a routine I have done many, many times. Today, however, things were gonna be different.

As usual I held the handbrake and yanked it up, only this time, instead of the handbrake, it was just my hand which went up, with enough force to make my phone slip out of the hand, jump a couple of feet into the air, and land directly on my balls.
The phone weighed 200 grams, so it pains. A lot.

Tl;dr: Don't try to pull on the handbrake whole holding your phone if you don't want your phone to bungee jump and kiss your balls.",166
TIFU because of a fox tail butt plug,t2_4v3p75xu,"Long time lurker, first time poster! Here we go...

My    husband, brother, and I were going to a casino for a small getaway    vacation. My mother volunteered to stay at my house and watch my dogs    while we were away for a few days. She would be over in a few hours, so I    was cleaning the house. A package arrived at my door, which ended up    being a fox tail butt plug and ears I purchased a few weeks prior. I    opened it and put it on my bed... My super conservative Church of  Christ   mother comes over to watch the dogs. We are casually talking,  while I   show her things around the house. I walk into the room, and my  dumb ass   totally forgets I have the butt plug on the bed. My mother  quickly  steps  against the wall with her eyes widened. She asks, ""Do I  have to  watch  that too?"", while pointed at the bed. My cheeks turned  red, as I  did not  know what to say! I just asked, ""what?!"" She  replied, the  RACCOON! My  mother legit believes I have a raccoon  hanging out on my  bed. I bust out  in laughter, with her still  mortified of this creature.  I do have a  history of having weird  animals, so this makes sense to me  that she had  that belief. I quickly  grab the butt plug and toss it in  the closet,  while she decided to  now be okay with it and very gently  ""petted it"".  NOW SHE BELIEVES I  COMMITTED SOME HORRIBLE ANIMAL ABUSE. I  tell her not  to worry about  it, and it will be fine. After much  convincing it is  nothing that will  die, we are able to leave. I told my  brother and my  husband on the  way what happened, and we all had a  great laugh.

It   was about a month  later at a restaurant that we told her what it was.  I  am not sure if  she was more upset her daughter is not vanilla, that   tail butt plugs or  a thing, or the fact she petted it.

TL;DR   My mother was going to house sit and noticed a fox tail butt plug,  that  she believed was a live raccoon she would have to keep alive",64
TIFU by wanting to shape my eyebrows,t2_3e35y1ty,"This happened about an hour ago, and I still feel awful.


Bit of backstory; I live in a very rural area with ~1500 people, give or take. Everyone knows everyone, and I've lived here the vast majority of my life.

I also suffer pretty badly with mental health, and have been on medication for the past 5 or so years. There is one pharmacy where I live, which I go to every week. I have gotten to know the staff quite well.


Okay, so today I decided that my eyebrows needed tidying up. Quarantine has not been kind to them, and the look of having shrubbery on my face was not a good one. 
Tried plucking them this morning, lasted about 10 seconds before giving up because that shit hurts, and went back to my desk to go on with work. Decided my hairy caterpillar brows will live to see another day.


Lunchtime hits, and I need to get my medication for the week so I go down to my local pharmacy. Go to the counter, ask for my prescription, yada yada, same as every week.

Then I noticed they had dermablades for sale, and I've heard they are very good for shaping your brows.

For those unfamiliar, they're basically a razor on a stick that you can use on your face.

So there I am, anti depressants and anti psychotics in one hand, and razors on a stick in the other hand, grinning like a mad man because I'm very pleased with myself for finding a pain free way to do my eyebrows.


The pharmacist, who I've gotten to know quite well over the years, instantly looks upset and worried. But fucking empty brain me did not put 2 and 2 together, and continued chatting to her like I always would.

Eventually she asked if I'd like to talk and took me into that separate room you would use for consultations, and asked me if I'm struggling, and if I have any plans to harm myself. This sweet lady was genuinely concerned I was in a very dark place, and just wanted to help me.

I quickly assured her that I am not going to do that at all, I just wanted nice eyebrows and ironically was too much of a little bitch to deal with the pain of plucking.


I feel so incredibly bad for worrying that sweet poor soul. I just wanted cute brows



TLDR; too much of a bitch to pluck my eyebrows, went to the pharmacy to pick up psychiatric medication, bought some face razors, and made a sweet old lady think I was going to try and injure myself.",22
TIFU By Convincing My Sister that Rats lay Eggs,t2_8a5u3gxc,"This happened just a few minutes ago,

But first some background this afternoon my Sister and I were talking about random things to pass time, and I thought to prank her, and so I just randomly very nonchalantly said ""Did you know that Rats lay eggs"".

She didn't believe me, but was not sure, so I said to google it, and I thought this would be where this would end and I would have a good laugh that she even considered this to be true.

But when she googled (Do rats lay eggs?), and this showed up:

Google Confirmed that Yes Indeed! Rats give 4 eggs at a time on the home page, and my sister was so shocked that she didn't even open the link, because she thought I knew this and apparently was just informing her of a known fact.
 Link for Reference:

https://www.google.com/search?q=do+rats+lay+eggs&amp;oq=do+rats+lay+eggs&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l4.3092j0j7&amp;client=ms-unknown&amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;ie=UTF-8

She now seemed to believe this and I couldn't believe my luck that some Google Article had convinced her that rats lay eggs, so I kept teasing her saying: How did you not know this ?, What do they teach you at school? etc, at which point she got angry and left and I had a good laugh and thought that to be the end.

But that's where I fucked up, My Sister at dinner today while talking to my mom about her day, told her she found out today that rats lay eggs, which caused me to nearly choke on my food, but managed to pass it as just a cough, and my mom thought it was a joke as well and snorted at this too, but when my sister kept insisting that ( Rats do Lay Eggs ), she began to get angry, and when apparently to prove her point she showed her the Google page, she began saying stuff like Kids These Days believe anything, Fairy tales and stuff, that's when my sister began to get angry too.

They both got into a shouting match, which quickly devolved into things other than the Egg Laying Rat, which led to my Sister getting her Phone Privileges taken away until "" she learns some manners "" and is also grounded for a Month.

My sister is now in her room fuming and I am here writing this stuff to reddit, I feel really bad for my sister and scared that this could turn on me too, if it gets out that I told her this, What should I do, Would like some advice :(

TL;DR I convinced my sister that Rats lay eggs which by a stroke of luck was confirmed by Google, when she told my mom this at dinner they both got in a shouting match both refusing to back down, which ended with my sister's phone being taken away and her being grounded for a month.",11
TIFU eating too much cannabutter,t2_79zd1oj0,"(I'm in Canada where it's legal)

So I'm still recovering from this FU yesterday, I made butter for the first time and was really excited so I made brownies with them, thinking I mixed it with the normal butter and dosed the pan properly. Apparently not, because I had one piece and was fine, so I had another about an hour later and got baaaaaaaad high. There must've been a hotspot or something because dear lordy that went from 0-100 right quick.

I was useless on the couch shivering and anxious bad high, I couldn't focus visually on anything I could barely string a thought together other than ""i think I messed up"" It was not fun and lessons were learned. That was not my usual drunk equivalent, that felt like an OD that kept going. I ate the brownies around lunch and couldn't move till I think it was around 9ish when I crawled into bed.

I feel so gross today, like when you're getting over the flu and everything's achy and your stomach is sore from cramping up and you're nauseous but not enough to throw up. I don't feel good and I'm NEVER doing that again.

TIFU by filling out paperwork wrong and getting my entire first check since the pandemic taken in taxes,t2_zn8xs,"So my husband and I got married this year due to the fact that I had lost my job and I needed the insurance (we were already planning a wedding but had to move it up). With the world being what it is money has been very tight and losing my job at this moment in time has been pretty catastrophic for us financially. But among the perks I was looking forward to was getting to file our taxes together since I made almost nothing this year and he made a lot.

I finally got a job that started at the beginning of December and filled out my tax forms like you do when you start a new job. In the last few years we found out that my husband had filled out his taxes wrong two years in a row and we’ve been dinged for a lot of money from the IRS two years in a row so I was nervous filling out the form and wanted to make sure that with this new filing status I was doing everything right. 

Welp when I was filling out the W4 I got to the part where it says “other income” and since my husband and I are filing together and I didn’t want to mess up I put down his income because that’s what I thought it was saying...cut to two paychecks later when HR finally figures out why I’m not getting my checks....it has all gone to taxes and no it doesn’t matter that your behind on your house payments because NO they aren’t giving it back

TIFU by trying to rescue a cat in a trap.,t2_78xap9i,"Tifu by trying to rescue a cat. I was walking in the woods and spotted a cat with it's leg caught in a dog proof trap. It wasn't my trap. The cat was flipping out, screaming, and trying to free his leg. I went home and got some welding gloves and a screwdriver to open the trap with.

When I returned, there was a dog barking at the cat, and it was even more agitated. As I approached it would continue to wrap the chain around the tree it was attached to. I continued this until it's leg was starting to bend around the tree as well. He stretched his body away from me and was quite pissed about the situation. I just couldn't leave him there. 

I put a coat on and the heavy leather welding gloves on and tried to hold it still so he couldn't tear me up or hurt himself. Almost instantly it bit through the gloves and into my hand. I pulled back and waited for a minute. Then I tried again, this time thinking that I could get the back of it's neck and calm it like I have done with a kitten before. A terrible idea in hindsight, but I really thought it would buy me enough time. This time it somehow turned it's head towards my fingers, sunk it's teeth into my ring and pinky finger, and ripped the pads off of my fingers. I jerked my hand back losing the glove, and it just kept chewing up the glove like it was my hand. These were deep bites, and a lot of blood from the missing skin that used to be a fingerprint. The shock made it feel pretty numb at first. 

I did get the trap open without restraining the cat finally. Originally I thought it would try to attack, but it just made a big scene while I worked. It tried to stay as far from me as possible. He is fine, and ran away, jumping in the air, and climbing trees. Hopefully without a newfound taste for my blood lol.

In hindsight, I would have put my coat over the cat to protect myself, and the cat. I would have never dreamed it was possible for it to do so much damage through these gloves. Now that I'm thinking clearly, I can remember my cats crunching through bones when they eat scraps, or kill rabbits. I might be lucky I still have a finger. 

I hope I am wiser now.

tl;dr : I tried to rescue a trapped cat, wore gloves, and still got injured pretty good. The cat is fine.

Edit: Thank you for advising me to get a rabies and tetanus shot. I had not considered this until you guys reminded me of it. I will call my doctor's office asap. Thanks for taking the time to let me know the danger.

Edit2: Turns out, first day I had to get two shots in each finger that got bit, then in my shoulder, and one in each butt cheek. I have four more rounds to go over the next 28 days. The next round won't be near as bad. It will just be split between the shoulders and butt. It would have only been 14 days if I wasn't on immune therapy and chemotherapy.",68
TIFU by hugging a stranger.,t2_68vojuic,"This happened a loooooooong time ago, but I thought I should share it.

It was a hot summer day and my grandpa had decided to take me, my sis and cousins to the beach with his small green car, which I adore till this very day. My grandpa was sitting outside while we played in the sand. At some point, I went to take something from our beachbag and gave my grandpa a hug from behind ( ik it seems weird, but i was like 7ish) and said ""thanks grandpa for bringing us to the beach!""

He turned around and to my complete horror, it was not him....

then I remembered he said he would move to another spot bc there was plenty of sun exposure where we were originally sitting (I have a horrible memory)....

the man looked as confused as me. The only thing I could studder was a ""s-s-s-sorry....I thought you were m-m-m-my grandpa"" which made it even more akward. 

At this point I just ran off and finally remembered where my grandpa was ( he wasn't even that far, I still question how i didnt see him).

Til this very day, I wanna punch myself whenever I remeber it or it gets brought up (it has become my mum's and grandpa's favourite story).

 TL;DR: I have a shitty memory and hugged a random dude thinking they were my grandpa.",5
TIFU by not staying with him,t2_9opgkgfu,"Obligatory ""not today"" this happened 38 years ago but I only realised today it was a fuck up and this is about a gay experience, so don't read if that bothers you.

When I (58M) was 20, naive, unexperienced and in college. I read an article in the college newspaper about a gay bar and for some reason was curious and decided to go and check it out. I had, at least in my memory, never really had a thing for men.

When I walked in the first time, I was extremely nervous and very surprised to see a few men that I knew from college, work, etc.. I sort of migrated to one that I knew who did the design of the stores windows in the retail place I worked at and hung out with him for a while. The whole time I was there, I was being asked to dance, given free drinks, ass was being pinched, and being rubbed against by men. It was a hot, exciting night but I was so overwhelmed and confused, I just hung out with my friend until it got to be too much for me and I went home.

The thing is, I kept going to the gay bar and usually ended up hanging out with my friend and it got to the point that were beginning to be know as a couple and I sort of liked it. We danced a lot, did the poppers thing while dancing and grew closer and the sexual atmosphere was really hot but I was nervous, naive and just scared of what it all meant for me if I was “gay”. He was really patient with me and I knew he wanted me in every way possible and I wanted him too but scared.

One night we ended up in his place after the bar and took something to relax. I lost all inhibitions that night and had the best sex of my life. He fucked me and I came without even touching myself, I fucked him and swallowed his load, we sucked each other off and collapsed hours late in sweaty pile in a spoon position with him holding my cock as we cuddled.

I really think that I loved him, but couldn’t deal with the fact that I might be gay, what it would mean and pulled back from him. I still went to the bar, ended up in bed with several other men, even got a hickey on my neck from one guy the night before I went out on a date with a woman who ended up being the love of my university life, fortunately my roommate at the time applied make up to cover the hickeys.

Looking back on it, I really wish that I had stayed with him and at least let the relationship run it’s course but I was so scared. I got older, got married, had a child, became a single dad and have been questioning my sexuality ever since. I have hit the gay saunas, blown as many men as I could there and am still scared of being gay.

I love women and am not generally attracted to men, just their cocks but I think that I really fucked up not staying with him.

TLDR was so scared of being gay, that I left a guy who might have been Mr Right.

Edit: added gay subject warning, seems to be upsetting people",36
TIFU at work by clicking reply all to an email sent to thousands of employees,t2_k26mrtd,"At my work, tech maintenance sends a daily email to everyone at the company about the current status. Last night there was a tech issue, and the tech employees used reply all in their messaging with each other. I got to work today, to see that I had 50 emails from the tech workers talking to each other about the problem. Everyone in the company also got these emails. I saw other people email the tech team and tell them to take them off the tech list. After getting more emails, I decided to tell them that too. Instead of just replying to the tech team, I accidentally clicked reply all to the tech distribution list of everyone at the company. Needless to say, I got emails from random employees at the company telling me to learn how to use outlook, and scolding me. The President of the Company, and other high up executives, are also apart of the distribution list. I told my coworkers and they laughed and said it was a just a mistake, and not to worry. They said this happens frequently.

TIFU by asking my husband about Pokemon,t2_1di3pvbs,"Okay, so this happened a few days ago, of course. My husband and I were in bed at night, and I was feeling pretty horny, so I definitely wanted to have sex. We were cuddling and talking and stuff, and in an attempt at being sexy, I asked him how his pokemon campaign was going. 

So a bit of background, he's currently playing Heartgold doing the Nuzlocke challenge. It's when you play through the game but when your pokemon die, they're actually dead. Or something like that? He's been talking to me about it nonstop.

Okay, so back to the story, I was trying to be sexy by asking him how his Nuzlocke challenge was going because I thought he'd think ""ooh, she cares about my Pokemon endeavors, that's so sexy."" 

Anyway, he answered my question... For a long time... We did not have sex that night.

TIFU by saying FY to a stranger,t2_1lnqq5k4," 

Not really today, but some time ago, my friend and I went to a pool place. There were many pool tables, but still enough space to manouvre around and play.

It was my turn to play, I was deeply focused to pot a ball, when all of the sudden my cue gets hit by someone. I thought it were my friends, trying to make a joke on me.. So I just simply said ‘f\*ck youuu’ refocused and played. After that I turned around, and I see my friends, looking to me in an odd way, I ask, who of you hit my cue?? They replied: none of us.. So I looked to the other table, and a man was also playing so he must have accidentally hit my cue..

Scared I walked to him, explained why I said that, and excused myself like 3 times..

To this day I still feel a bit bad about it.. even though he was okay with it, and found it funny.  


TL;DR Said f\*ck you to a stranger after he hit my cue accidentally in a game of pool. (Thought it were my friends) And apologized soon after.",35
TIFU by sniffing my sister's panties,t2_6fk2ujo1,"So I've been hooking up with this girl for about a year. She came over a few nights ago while my parents were out. We chilled for a little bit and then we went in my room and had sex. After she left, I looked around my bed in case any article of clothing was left behind. My parents are super religious and would not be okay with me casually banging some chick and I really didn't need them getting in my business. I didn't see anything and thought I was in the clear

A few hours later I went in my room and saw a pair of panties lying on the floor. I froze. They looked pretty similar to the girl's. I thought ""*no way in* ***fuck.****""* How could I have missed these? Thankfully my parents hadn't come home yet, only my sister did. But she never comes in my room so I thought ""*that was close.""* I picked up the panties and decided to give  them a few sniffs because I had never sniffed any before lol. Just then, my sister walked in the room and screamed to the top of her lungs. I told her to keep it down and she snatched them from my hands. She asked me why the fuck I was sniffing her underwear.  I was really embarrassed and told her I thought they were someone else's. My sister never met this girl before and didn't believe me at first so I promised to show her some dirty snaps we sent each other if she promised not to tell my parents. Then I asked her what the fuck her panties were doing in my room. Apparently she was doing her laundry earlier and came in my room with the laundry basket in her arms to ask me something. I wasn't there at the time, probably in the bathroom or something. A pair of her panties must have fell out and she never noticed

TIFU by swan diving into my roommate’s head.,t2_9odgsiq1,"For once this actually did happen today. A little over 2 hours ago, I was playing some pickup basketball with my roommate. Full disclosure, we are both super competitive and so it’s no surprise that we both desperately wanted to win this meaningless game of pickup at the gym. 

With 2 points to go for the win and my roommate down by 1, he was pushing hard to try to get a basket to tie it up. Unfortunately for him, his dribbling was getting really sloppy and I was able to bat the ball away from him. As it bounced away, we both wanted to get the ball and dove for it. He got there first. 

Crack! I get there a tenth of a second after he does, but instead of getting the ball, I ended up diving eye-first into the crown of his head. Immediately I felt some intense pain radiate from below my eyebrow and when I opened my eye I could already see a lump forming and starting to cover my eye. Despite my competitive nature, I was willing to cede the rest of the game so I could get some ice on the golf ball that was quickly growing over my eye. After 20 minutes, my eye looked like [this. ](https://imgur.com/a/A96GCxS)

I held out some small measure of hope that my eye would get better as I iced it, but the lump quickly went from golf ball sized to baseball sized and now my eye looks like [this.](https://imgur.com/a/zO2sq53)

Can’t wait for work tomorrow where I get to do a big presentation in front of the CEO with a huge black eye. Needless to say, their attention will be on me!

TIFU by saying the right thing to the wrong person.,t2_56n08ek0,"Admittedly this happened about 5 years ago, and after telling a friend this story she encouraged me to share it with you fine fucker uppers. I'm writing this from my phone so excuse any poor formatting and/or waffling on.

Going back about 5 years and I was working at the local garage as a tyre fitter/mechanic, the work was pretty mindless but the guys I worked with were all good value and we all got along really well, we still occasionally catch up and I still cope a bit of flak for this fuck up. 

Anyway one morning before I got there someone had dropped in a set of 4 brand new wheels to have 4 new tyres fitted, my boss (a bit of a hardass who owned the shop and also another across town) asked me to have it done within the hour because the person who owned the wheels would be back in to have them fitted to the car at about (x) time. Piece of cake. As I'm fitting the tyres I admire the wheels that I'm working on, they were genuine forged wheels, about 10"" wide with a deep dish and looked extremely expensive, so I thought somehow I will compliment the owner on his choice of wheels when I see him. I finished fitting the tyres and move onto the next job. 

Fast forward a little bit and I have to leave the store to go get parts for said next job, when I return there is a different car on my hoist and a colleague had already removed the wheels, he let me know that this was the vehicle that was to have the brand new wheels fitted and that the customer was in the waiting room. I got right to work, within about 10minutes it was done and I drove the car off the hoist and into the carpark. My work colleague and I both remarked on how good the car looked with it's new feet, I thought now's my chance to go and compliment the customer on his choice of wheels. 

We both go into the waiting room where there is only one customer sitting and the first thing I said to him was ""far out mate those wheels looks great, they must have cost you an arm and a leg!!"" I have never seen someone's facial expression change so fast, complete elation to explosive anger in a fraction of a second. My colleague gaps it out of the room as he obviously sensed the impeding doom whilst I am none the wiser, then the abuse began.. ""You're a real funny fucker aren't you?! Must think you're real cool taking the mick out of someone else's misfortune, go get your boss before I punch your fucking lights out!"" Etc etc etc. This went on for about a minute, I locked up, not knowing what to say or do because I had no idea what I'd done, I stutter a bunch but eventually do what he said and I went to go get my boss, who by this point had heard the swearing and yelling and knew something was up. He told me to go make a cup of coffee and he'll see if he can get to the bottom of it. 

I go to the break room where I find my colleague doubled over in the corner wetting himself with uncontrollable laughter. He's trying to tell me something but can't get the words out in between bouts of hysterics, eventually he gets it across... ""That dude, he was in a motorbike accident a while ago, he's got a prosthetic leg and a false arm.."" then once again breaking out in hysterics. The significance of this didn't quite dawn on me until I recounted what I had initially said to him. My heart sunk and I felt like the biggest piece of shit, all the while my work mate thinks it is literally the funniest thing he has ever witnessed.

As it turns out the guy was so mad because he had told my colleague about his accident earlier,  assumed we were all aware of his disability/situation and therefore my comment about paying for his wheels with an arm and leg was me making a premeditated malicious joke at his expense.. fuccccckkkkkk

Customer grudgingly paid his bill, left the shop unhappy vowing to never come back, and then wrote a bad review on Google. I got a barrelling from my boss about paying more attention but mostly the vibe from it was shit happens get back to work and make me more money.

TL/DR;
Unknowingly made fun of a disabled person, got the company I work for a bad google review. Still feel terrible.",22
"TIFU by fighting my cousin, putting him in the hospital, and going to get sued by them.",t2_6lb3cjj3,"
For some more context before this story, I recently split up my family somehow by saving my grandpa and breaking things in his body. [Link to other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kqqvqp/tifu_by_almost_killing_my_grandpa_and_splitting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)


Anyways, this morning I was waiting outside the hospital and asked the doctor to come outside to tell me how he’s doing but instead my grandma came. She tells me he’s doing fine but is having some back pains and having trouble moving. She went back inside and I continued to wait. My parents were also here but only my mom was with me since this was my dads father. About 30 minutes after my grandma went back inside, my cousin, same cousin who tried to fight me and the uncle too, came over to see how he’s doing. As soon as they saw me, they came over and gave me some shit. I tried to ignore them. And it sort of worked. My uncle went inside, as he was my dads brother and wanted to see my grandpa. Right when my uncle walked in, my cousin, who is a year older than me came over and tried to get in my face. I told him to knock it off but he didn’t and I noticed at that point he was getting ready to punch me. I am a pretty big dude and he is a couple inches smaller than me. A fight ensues and I have the upper hand. Nearing the end of the fight, he’s getting weaker. And I try and back off, which he takes as a sign to go full blown batshit crazy. I defend and get him on the ground and he goes ballistic and started screaming in pain. My mom and I rush him inside for some help. 

The rest of it is fuzzy but I later heard I broke something in his right arm and all of that family has blocked me on everything and are planning on suing me. Funny thing is, my grandpa is a lawyer and he has told me stories of some of the cases he took. So I’m thinking they are crazy for this but I’m still annoyed I’ll have to do all that legal work. My grandpa is doing better as of now but still in some pain. 

TL;DR Cousin fights over me saving my grandpa and I break his bone and gonna get sued.

Edit: For those who are asking, I did break his ribs I just didn’t find it necessary to put that in since he is so old and many of you guys seem to also be familiar with CPR and the Heimlich Maneuver.",644
TIFU showing my main Reddit to my coworker... but not as much as he FU'd showing me his.,t2_89o6medr,"Alternate account for privacy reasons. 

So, hey, coworker. If you are brave enough to come back to Reddit after today I am sorry I am telling Reddit about this but it is just too funny.

TL:DR at the bottom.

So I fuck up a lot in a day. Really, I could have posted here before a few times, but this really takes the cake. 

I (F) work in tech support. We pretty much all use Reddit. So when I posted a picture of my cat and it got over 1k likes, I was like hooray! Coolios! And I sent the link to 3 of my coworkers (M) to show how proud I was of her, and to give them a little chuckle cause they all like cats too.

Then I remembered oh, shit... i post NSFW stuff on my Reddit.

Now it's not what you think!! I was more embarassed that I had stuff tagged NSFW. I'm really into piercings/tattoos/mods and post mildly bloody stuff sometimes, so naturally they are flagged nsfw. Nothing I'd be fired about, but I didn't want them to think I was willy nilly posting nudes and linking people to my Reddit.

So I shared this funny little anxiety attack with the one coworker who had an incredible fuckup today.

I went on with my day and worked for oh, idk, an hour before checking in on the progress my cat had make with likes. 1.1k likes. Nice! And a new follower?? what a treat!

Oh, what a... weird pervy username? NSFW profile? Might be body mods though?

So I peeked behind my shoulder, no one in the office, and unblurred the images.

Oh MAN that's a lot of dong. Oh? He's holding a local brew? Oh... he's from the city I live in...

All the while sharing these findings with my coworker. 

Now, I say he's my coworker, as in we work IT for the same company. I mostly escalate work to his team and we have a good working relationship but we work with different teams at different sites. I've seen him in person 3 times, total. I hardly recognized him on the street to be perfectly honest, we talk over the phone or through the work IM system.

So anyway I'm describing this pervy weirdo to my colleague because CRAZY COINCIDENCE, HE LIVES IN THE SAME CITY AS ME!

... I'm not very bright, guys.

Thank GOD I picked the right one of the 3 of my coworkers to present my findings to of this TOTALLY WACKY COINCIDENCE.

So he says ""oh god. Im sorry. I didnt know you could see who your followers were""

Cue cry-laughing at my desk. Guys I had to go into the utility room to call my best friend absolutely hysterical about this.

I ESCALATE TECH SUPPORT TO HIM. IT DID NOT OCCURR TO ME THAT HE WOULD MAKE SUCH AN OVERSIGHT.

So yeah we talked about it. He's an incredibly valuable member of our team, super professional, and just a nice guy. Apparently with an exhibitionist streak...

TLDR: Shared a cat photo with my coworkers and was embarassed by some body mod posts I made being marked NSFW. One coworker followed me and did not know I could see all of his very NSFW nude content.

I am not going to HR. I told my husband who also knows him. We had a really good laugh about it. Resuming business as usual tomorrow.

Edit: typo

Edit 2: minor details that would've bugged me

Edit 3: oh yeah... after he calmed down a bit I told him that when you delete your Reddit account it doesn't actually delete the photos so they're still just there chillin. He said he felt less awful now that he's calmed down, and he'll deal with it another time. What's done is done 🤷‍♀️

Edit 4: I guess I didn't make it super clear but he *deleted his account*",191
TIFU by letting a woman get stalked,t2_13m41scw,"This happend 15 minutes ago and I'm still overwhelmed. I see these stories everyday on Reddit and I never thought this would happen infront of my eyes.

 I was on my way home on an empty road and I saw a car parked in the middle of the road, man inside and engine on. I didn't think much of it. There was a woman in her 30s standing on the sidewalk and typing on her phone right next to the car. As I walk by she gave me a look, I felt like she needed help, I didn't do anything but I remained very suspicious. Once I got away from them I kept looking over my shoulder to make sure everything is fine, once the woman starts walking away slowly and the car slowly catches up to her, she makes a stop the car does too. She speeds up the car does too. That's when I realized that the look really meant something.

I regret not doing anything, or not going back to her. Because I didn't know what to do or say, it was daylight and around the corner (10 meters away from them) all the shops were open and there were many people in that area so I thought once she gets there she will be fine. I'm worried and I'll blame myself if I hear on the news that something happend to a woman from that area, I hope nothing bad happend to her.

tl;dr: walked next to woman being stalked, didn't realize she was being stalked until i got far away from her.",4

My girlfriend and I (20 M/F) are having sexy time after a great date night. We normally shower and clean up when we come back from dinner, but we were feeling it in the air tonight, so that was skipped. We’re into bdsm and she’s tied up and we’re doing our thing. I decided to lube up a finger and put it in her booty. All is well until i feel something tap the top of my finger, it didn’t take me long until I realized I had found some brown treasure in her cave. I didn’t want to make it a big deal and embarrass her so I slowly pull my finger out and tell her “I’ll be back I’m gonna go grab something” but I really just leave her tied up and go wash my hands. I come back like nothing happened and avoided the booty for the rest of sexy time

After we were done I had mentioned what happened with her bumbum. At first she was embarrassed, but we ended up laughing it off and now it has become an inside joke.

TIFU by oversleeping,t2_4cxqxgc6,"I am a teenager that struggles to balance everything I have to do and naturally I loose sleep because of that. I have to take the bus to school, (see what the fuck up revolves around) even though my dad is still home as he doesn’t leave until 9:00 and he would have to get me there at 8:15 before I’m late he refuses to take me. He has yelled at me, insulted me, and taken away stuff I enjoy, but that’s not what I’m mad about, most of that was well deserved, I’m upset as he refused to take me to school despite having nothing stopping him. Luckily for me there’s an online option too since covid but I need to be in person as I have ADHD and can barely focus so all I will be getting from doing online school is attendance. 
            I now understand why my sister has moved far away from us as she would have had to deal with him acting like this on a daily basis. I’m writing this in the 5 minute transition from one class to another so I won’t be back until my lunch in a few hours.

TIFU by being gay and not realizing it.,t2_9ef0cuhz,"A guess this isn’t really a TIFU but more like a “my whole life I fucked up” but whatever.

I was scrolling through the YouTube trending page one day when a saw a YouTube channel by James Charles. Now I’m I straight man (or so I thought) and for my whole life I was attracted to girls. I grew up having crushes on celebrities like Halle Berry and J-Lo but I never ever liked or even felt remotely attracted to a man. Then I saw this guy. I don’t know what it is about him. His smile, his face, his everything. He is just so hot. I thought I was straight but I guess I’ve just been living a lie. I’m no longer attracted to girls. All I can think of is him. I always watch his videos and imagine myself with him. Just the thought of meeting him makes me feel, you know. I fall asleep just imagining kissing him. I don’t know what to do. My girlfriend has been asking me what’s wrong with me for the past few days and I don’t know what to tell her. I don’t like her anymore. I like her to hang out with but sex with her just doesn’t even sound pleasing. I just want to be with James. It’s so unhealthy I know but I just can’t even think of being with a women anymore. I know I’ll never be with James but now I have no idea what to do with my family and my gf. It’s going to be rough until I get the strength to come out.

TIFU by eating too much fish,t2_3u0lnzvl,"So, yesterday me and my girlfriend decided we wanted to eat some japanese food and we ordered tons of dogfish sashimi (don't know if this is common in other parts of the world, but here there usually is three main fishes used in japanese food: salmon, tuna and dogfish and I REALLY, REALLY, enjoy the dogfish). We ate and everything was normal.

Went to sleep and woke up today normally. Went to the bathroom to take a shit and noticed there were tiny drops of oil in the toilet just there, floating with my shit, it was a very scary moment and I thought I was very sick. I noticed my underwear was dirty with some kind of oil, as well as my bed sheets.

Did some research and apparently what happened is that dogfish is so freaking oily that your body just cannot process all that oil and just gets rid of it through your ass, where the oil slowly leaks out of you. There is no way for you to notice this is happening, since the oil has the same temperature of your body and apparently your asshole is not tight enough to retain the oil, so it's kinda of an unnoticeable, unretainable diarrhea 

Also, there is nothing you can do to ger rid of it, except waiting...

TIFU my first time buying condoms,t2_9nfd5ceh,"Posted this in r/sex yesterday but the mods eventually removed it because it didn't apply to that sub or something. Some of the comments suggested I come here. So here I am.

In a few days, if all goes well, I will no longer be a virgin. I've been doing everything possible to prepare for what's to come, which is how I ended up at the convenience store two days ago to purchase condoms for the first time ever. Not gonna lie, it did feel really awkward standing in a queue with a snickers bar in one hand and a box of condoms in the other. Maybe it was just my imagination but I could feel people staring. It also didn't help that on the box was a half naked woman preparing to take off her pants. If that wasn't awkward enough, as soon as the cashier had to scan my condoms, the scanner somehow stopped scanning. The cashier raised the box of condoms towards the heavens like it was baby Simba... just to check the big ass barcode printed on the bottom.

The cashier apologized and said she's new before proceeding to call one of the other cashiers to come over and assist. At that moment I was tempted to just abort the mission and leave, but I convinced myself it couldn't get any worse. I was wrong. Cashier #2 showed up, and lo and behold, it's one of the girls at my school. We're not friends or anything but we've seen each other at school enough times to prompt a ""hey you"". Cashier #2 noticed the condoms and I could tell, even behind her mask, she was struggling to keep a straight face. So, instead of just keeping my mouth shut, I blurted out ""it's for my dad!"". Both cashiers froze and looked at me like they were scared I was gonna go into more detail. Long story short, I got the condoms and got out, but now I got PTSD or some shit.

If it was any other product in the store, none of the above would've been weird. So why is buying condoms so damn awkward? Or maybe it's just me, I dunno. All I know is... I ain't going back there ever again. 

TL:DR Went shopping for condoms at the convenience store. It seemed like the people in the store were judging me. I became awkward and without thinking said the condoms were for my dad. My dad!!! Lol so stupid.",2567
TIFU- should have known it felt too good,t2_2ox6szxh,"Many years ago on my first ever date we're sat in the cinema with our arms on the armrests with pinkies slowly getting closer and closer. That first ever romantic touch to another human was electric when the fingers brushed and she didn't recoil. So, I'm in a pretty blissful state and over the next hour things progress astonishingly quickly (by the standards of my life at the time) to the point where we're now fully holding hands and our arms are interlocked, i.e. my arm is on her side of the shared armrest and hers is on my side. 

Just when I think things can't get any better, she reaches over with her other hand and starts stroking my forearm. I obviously reciprocate and start stoking her forearm too, just gently up and down. I was convinced this was the happiest anyone had ever been. Even now, when I'm familiar with the fulness of physical joys, I'd still say the combination of simplicity, passion, innocence and chemistry of that moment are pretty unrivalled. I let out the tiniest moan of happiness. As I'm in that moment, I feel something with my finger but think nothing of it, I see her look down though. She looks confused, so I look down, and it turns out that our two hands hit. She's already figured it out, but it took me a moment to realise that for the last few minutes we've both been stroking my forearm and our fingers just hit.
She recoils, I sit there motionless, I think back to those stupid games where you try and guess how many fingers are drawing on your back but you can't tell, then I panic that she thinks I'm some selfish self-pleasuring freak. She sits back and watches the rest of the movie with her arms folded. I plan what to say or do at the end of the movie and come up with the foolproof plan of just pretending nothing happened. She one-upped this plan by proceeding to pretend I never happened. 

Still have the happy memory of my first touch though! 

Tl;dr - convinced my date I'd be an incredibly selfish love partner by accidentally and unknowingly  pleasuring myself instead of her.",10
TIFU by sleeping in my zoom meeting,t2_986hi59u,"Basically, I am doing online school and I am doing zoom calls. I am horrible at waking up on time even with an alarm clock I still manage to fuck it up. So, I just stay up so I can get on at the exact time which is 9:25. Today, I was so tired and I had my computer on my bed and I was in the zoom call. I was so tired, I went to sleep. However, I checked the time and it was 11:58. Over two hours. I overslept and I fucked up. We were now on break but I kept on getting spammed my friends saying how the teacher was asking where I was. My mom texted me because apparently my teacher emailed her about my 'absence'. She was really pissed off and she said I should've just went to bed early which I agree with.

TL;DR I skipped my school meetings by sleeping.",4
TIFU by creating a monster,t2_1uebb7ms,"So, I originally posted this in Malicious Compliance but it was removed and I was told it might fit here better. For some backstory my daughter(she's actually my step daughter, but she's my daughter none the less) is 11 who I'll call Princess because that's my nickname for her. I've been with my wife for 6 years and married for 4 of those years. We get along great, she spends time with me in the woodshop, play video games together, and she is developing my sense of humor. My wife loves to point out she is the definition of nurture vs nature. So basically I should have known something like this was coming.

One of our little things started because I felt like messing with her about a year ago at the dinner table when she asked ""Can I have the ketchup please"", I of course responded like every dad does ""I don't know, can you?"" This goes on and off being changed up with different pedantic variations such as ""sure you can see it"" and ""I mean I could, but the question is will I"". She also would get me with these as well much to my wife and hers delight. Now I do sprinkle in some actual parenting with this about teaching her how important it is to use words to convey your intent properly, but it's mostly just good ole fashion fun between father and daughter.

This all picked up with a fervor this week, where we each got each other multiple times during dinner 3 nights in a row, until she ended it last night with the sweetest compliance I've seen in a while. We were having tacos, and without thinking I asked her ""Sweetie, will you please pass me the cheese"" without missing a beat, she grabs the cheese and throws it right at me. I wasn't expecting it and it smacks me right in the face. My wife and I just sit there staring at her mouths agape and all she says is ""You told me to pass the cheese"". Through the laughter and mild humiliation, I have never been more proud.

TL;DR- Pedantic dad raises a pedantic daughter and has a bag of cheese thrown in his face at dinner.",116
TIFU open relationship trouble,t2_8pfxfxql,"TIFU Open relationship having some troubles

Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year now and we love each other, but recently there has been a lot of tension and we have started to fight a lot. It all started when we had a fight about me texting one of my exes (who is one of my good friends that he knows about) happy birthday. He kept saying that I shouldn't be in contact with any of my exes and that he felt betrayed. This was very weird because he knew about my ex and knew that we were still pretty close. During that time there was a lot of tension but he ended up just hate fucking me and forgetting about it. We also had a fight about me going to a work event and talking to other guys, even though they were my co workers and it was a work conference. He claimed that I was being flirty and trying to fuck other guys. This was completely untrue and I have done nothing to lead him to think that I would ever do something like that. We talked and he said that he was overreacting, which I agreed with. 

After that the tension still wasn't resolved and we had many other fights. We both noticed that and took some time to talk with each other, and are relationship and sex life improved greatly. We also opened up about our fantasies and he said he wanted to have a threesome. At first I was hesitant, but later agreed to it. We found this guy who was 6'4, muscular, and just overall very handsome. The original plan was to have a threesome with him but then my boyfriend said that he wanted us to mess around first so we could get to know each other. We both discussed some rules and then he let me go with the other guy. The other guy was so much different than my boyfriend. He was dominant and put me in my place (I liked this a lot). Me and the other guy had so much fun, and we tried lots of different stuff (Like bondage, punishments, anal, etc.). We also talked about a lot of deep stuff and I started to fall for this guy. I told my boyfriend about the feelings I had for the other guy and that we probably shouldn't have a threesome, I also told him we should probably cut all times with him. He said that it was fine and that it would be hotter because of the taboo aspect, and that it would be like unrequited love. I told him this was a bad idea, but he still wanted me to do it. 

So we get to the day of the threesome and my boyfriend cums fast, but still lets me and the other guy finish. You could tell when me and the other guy fucked there was a lot more passion. Later that night my boyfriend liked that another guy could have me and fuck all my holes. But, he said the threesome arrangement wasn't going to work, and he would much rather have an open relationship where both of us would get to fuck other people by ourselves. He would go with multiple people, but I only wanted the threesome guy. This arrangement worked for a couple months, but now my boyfriend says he wants me to cut all ties with the other guy because he feels that he can""t compare to him and that it will affect our sex life. I told him that it wasn't true and that i'm perfectly happy with our sex life, but he doesn't believe me.  He said we could fuck one more time but thats it. So the other guy came to my house and we started fooling around, but during it my boyfriend walked in and saw us. He was livid and said that we should be more careful and what we were doing was disgusting and we should be ashamed. He also was smashing and throwing things. We got into a big fight and he called me a ""worth nothing dirty whore who will take anyones dick"" this hurt a lot because of a past relationship that was verbally abusive. It also reminded me of when we used to fight a lot. When things cooled down he said I was going to have to choose between him and the other guy.
TL;DR
What me and the other guy did was completely consensual and he agreed on it. Why is he mad? What can I do to fix this? Who should I choose?",0
TIFU by accidently giving myself a facial,t2_3o93ytqh,"This happened just a few minutes ago. This was the most demoralizing and humiliating thing I have ever experienced in my entire sixteen years of being on this planet. I have been stripped of my humanity and dignity and I can no longer show my face around my family.

So a few minutes ago, (20 minutes or so) I was furiously masturbating to some porn. Now keep in mind I had been edging for about 45 minutes and the time finally came. I busted the biggest nut I had ever busted, I would have been proud of it if I hadn't glazed my face with my dna. My initial reaction was ""oh shit, well now I have to go wipe this shit off"", but then, the pain set in. My eye started to burn as if I had just rubbed a hot pepper all over it.

I have been in my bathroom washing my eye out, blinking, and doing anything I can to ease the pain. sadly it has been in vain, ever since the nut, my eye is bloodshot and is in constant, searing pain and irritation.

TL:DR - I edged for 45 minutes and jizzed into my eye, which is now in severe pain.",95
TIFU by taking home shells from the beach.,t2_stqhr7t,"This is ongoing from earlier.

Me (23F) and my fiance (31F) went to the beach earlier to kill time while waiting on some repairs for my car to get done. Was fun! Found a lot of shells, hermit crabs all over, dug up some clams and played with some pelicans!

There were 2 very pretty spiral shells that I loved and wanted to take home and use in a future Salt Water tank my fiance was planning. I made sure to check as well as I could that they were empty, rinsed the sand out, and stuck them in my pocket (for about 6 or 7 hours till we got home). 

When we did, I placed them next to the bathroom sink to wash more thoroughly later as I was feeling lazy at the moment. Mind you, these were pretty far from the edge, they wouldn't accidentally fall by themselves.From our room we suddenly heard the sound of something falling in the bathroom, and went to go check it. One of the shells were on the floor! Luckily it wasnt cracked and we just chalked it up to the cats being dumb, so I moved them higher on a cabinet.

About 45 minutes later, the same shell falls AGAIN. This time, there was 0 way a cat could have done it, so I checked the shell closer than I did before and found that it was inhabited! We made plans to go back tomorrow and release him and apologize for kidnapping lol

Well I went to check on something else while I left him on the counter by accident, and this time he must have fell on a pair of pants that was on the floor so we didn't hear him fall. We looked EVERYWHERE for him, and still haven't found him! My fiance is freaking out that theres a crab in the hotel room somewhere and that I'm an idiot for not watching or at least not putting him in the sink. 

I'm still looking for the SOB but I might make crab legs for dinner instead of realeasing him!

TL;DR: Went to the beach, picked up some shells,  then took 'em home. Found out one was  a home to a hermit crab, which is now missing somewhere in the hotel room. Sigh.",25
TIFU!!! My wife thinks I'm a Bronie. (Adult that loves My Little Pony),t2_4a0ydbc7,"TIFU!!! I was reading comment chains on a post and someone mentioned adults that worship my little pony.

They call them selves Bronies.

The guy in the comments was talking about a cancer patient that used his Make A Wish to turn himself into a pony, and these creeps made weird images with the pony even after being asked not to.

I found this to be disturbing, knowing I can not believe everything I read in comments, I wanted to see if this was true.

Well, after short investigation I found their hideout subreddit and clicked on it.

It was bad, pony porn everywhere.

before I could even comprehend what I was looking at, my wife walked in and asked ""WTF ARE YOU LOOKING AT""...

It took about an hour to explain to her what I was witnessing and to convince her I was not a said bronie.

F those dudes.

TL:DR...  I looked at pony porn and my wife saw.",36
TIFU by installing a virus on my mom’s computer.,t2_5hcgsbu0,"I‘m allowed to use her computer because I don‘t have one for myself. Long story short: I downloaded a ‚cracked‘ VST-Plugin for Ableton and checked it on virustotal. There were no detections so i just opened the file. Nothing happened but I got suspicious and tried to delete it. Windows wouldn’t let me delete the file, not even via cmd. I wanted to enter safe mode to  delete it so I restarted the computer. As soon as it booted a message was shown. It said that all my files were deleted, which i don‘t believe because that would have taken more time. Still, it was blocking me to access Windows so immediately shut down the pc. I then walked downstairs to my mom and told it to her. There are a lot of very important photos and videos on this pc, which are absolutely priceless to my mom. I think we now have to get some kind of technical support or something, just because I am stupid enough to download a Plugin that costs 100$ for free.

I believe that [this](https://vst-crack.com/serum-vst-crack/) is the site I downloaded the virus from but I‘m not sure. If you want to install it on a VM or something, go ahead.

TIFU by commenting “first like” on my friends Facebook status.,t2_d1kf0,"So this just happened not 20 minutes ago. Let me preface this by saying I was/am stoned, watching Jumanji, and on Facebook half paying attention. I was scrolling through my feed and saw one of my good friends post a photo of his dog with a caption. From what I remember, it said something to the extent of “My buddy, love you ❤️❤️❤️”. It had no comments or likes so I thought it would be funny to comment “first like”. 

I leave Facebook and continue watching the movie. About 10 minutes later I return to Facebook and start scrolling...once again. I came across the post a second time and read the caption only to find out it was a post about HIS DOG WHO HAD JUST DIED. 

The shame. The embarrassment. 

I immediately messaged him to tell him I’m sorry for the comment and how sorry I was to hear about his dog. I explained myself and no response. About 5 minutes later he got back to me and said it actually cracked him up and made his day a little better. 

Forgot me friends have a sense of humor. Thank god for that!

TIFU By Repeatedly Saying The Wrong Word During An Important Meeting,t2_3vikptdw,"I’m currently doing a co-op at this one company. Most of my work is just typing up documents for my employer and other companies as means of what’s currently happening. Basically just updating everything step by step. My supervisor thought it’d be a great idea for me to run the meetings, which isn’t bad it’s just reading words off the document. The thing was that I didn’t type this document up, my supervisor did and he’s an amazing guy but he thinks quicker than he types so there was bound to be spelling and grammar errors. 
So I’m reading along the lines of the document and fixing everything and I came across the word “simulated use.” I have no idea why I read it wrong but I repeatedly said “stimulated use.” The context makes it worse because my line was “this criteria can be found in stimulated use.” No one said anything but after the meeting my supervisor started dying of laughter. And he told me and now I’m super embarrassed. 

TLDR: used the word stimulated instead of simulated during a big meeting",1
TIFU by measuring my wheelie bin.,t2_8xxv7p18,"So today I (14M) was in my online science class and the teacher gave us a task to measure household objects. One of those objects was a wheelie bin so I decided to go out and do that experiment. So as you do when your about to measure your wheelie bin i wheeled it to a discreet location in between my dads car and the wall where I then got to it using my ruler(couldn’t be bothered to find a tape measure) to measure the size in cm of my wheelie bin. So I am just about finished with this incredibly valuable experiment that I am working on and I turn around to see the girl from next door (who has only just moved in and I have never met before) who had just got back from her run was giving me the weirdest...fucking... stare I have ever experienced that was clearly just screaming “WHAT IN ALL THATS HOLY IS THAT LAD DOING”. Now me being socially awkward just locked eyes with her frantically trying to think what to do next. Now a normal person in this situation would laugh it off and explain” haha yeah I’ve got to do this for a science experiment” and everyone would laugh and go on their merry way. Right? However this is me we’re talking about. So I decided just to look at the floor and practically run back into my house when the girl was still watching me probably wondering what the hell was wrong with me from a distance. No explanation. I didn’t even say hi and act like I was doing something perfectly normal. No. I just fucking ran like a constipated penguin back to my front door. I can only imagine what she thought I was doing and I feel like the biggest imbecile to walk this earth right now. She probably is now telling all her friends that she has a wheelie bin measuring weirdo for a next door neighbour. I don’t think I’ve cringed so hard in my life.

Tldr: Measured a wheelie bin and when my new next door neighbour got back decided to act like the weirdest human ever to walk this earth.",7
TIFU by having a naked brawl in my dorm room and permanently scarring my history teacher.,t2_kt7yl8v,"This happened about 2 years ago. For context I live in a high school dorm of all guys, and naturally we hang out a ton in each other’s rooms. That year my room was the central hang out zone and often I would let my friends chill out there when I had to leave real quick. One day I was in there with 2 friends and I had to go shower (I changed by putting the towel over me first and then unclothing) and I let my friends stay in my room while I was gone. Upon my return I kicked them both out cause it’s a lot more awkward getting changed from a towel to clothes, and I also wanted some alone time. Maybe I’m weird but when I’m alone in my room I like to just chill naked, idk it’s just more comfortable. 

Anyway this is the juicy part, so I’m kicked back in my recliner, butt naked and watching YouTube, when all of a sudden a hand emerges from my closet with a phone that’s recording. Following the hand and grinning mischievously is one of my dumbshit friends (not one of the two who were in there previously, apparently this guy had been hiding in my closet for over an hour playing brawl stars and waiting for the perfect moment to strike). Naturally I start freaking the fuck out and jump up from my recliner, using my laptop to cover my crotch as it was the only thing in close proximity to me. This whole time I’m screaming every profanity in my vocabulary at this dude to get tf out, but he won’t listen and keeps recording. I attempt to grab a pair of underwear, but I’m only able to swap them out with the laptop to cover my crotch, and don’t actually get the chance to put them on. I then grab this guy’s phone with one hand and attempt to wrestle it away, while elbowing him and covering my crotch with my underwear with the other hand. Naturally we’re making a lot of noise and I’m still screaming at him, and the two friends that I had just kicked out overhead from the hallway and are banging on the door wondering what kind of demon magically spawned in my room that caused me to make such a racket. Then to make matters worse the house advisor on the floor, a middle-aged female history teacher, hears the racket and decides to get involved, using her master key to unlock my door. Upon opening it she is graced with the sight of my naked body, only obstructed by a pair of underpants that I’m loosely holding over my crotch, in a full out wrestling match with this other dude, screaming my ass off. She screams so loud that the entire dorm heard her, and slams the door immediately. To make matters worse her seven year old son decided to come with her while she was on dorm duty, but thank god he was standing somewhat behind her and was shielded from the worst of it. After this my friend had a big OH SHIT moment and he got into some pretty serious trouble. But he was still my friend and so i didn’t mention the recording phone to the house advisor, cause that had grounds for some serious cp allegations and no one needed that, he ended up deleting the video anyway. But to top it all off this house advisor became my history teacher the next year, and I don’t think either of us ever fully recovered from the awkwardness. 

TL;DR Didn’t check my closet before being naked, ended up having to have a nude wrestling match with a dude that came out of it, house advisor saw it all and later had her as my history teacher.",131
TIFU By accidentally taking my spouse to one of those unexpected pregnancy pro-life clinics,t2_12llrg,"This happened a little over about a year ago. In December 2019 my(29m) common-law spouse(28f) and I found out we were having a baby. We had a girl! We love her dearly and she's really the best thing to happen to us. At the time however, the pregnancy was unexpected, unplanned and what Bob Ross might call a ""happy accident"".

We may not have known a single thing about having a baby, but we had our google toolbelts on and started doing some deep dives into what we need to do next. We didn't have a family doctor, didn't even know what Midwives do, couldn't tell family or friends just yet, but we wanted to make sure we do all the right things in this pregnancy. I googled something like ""unexpected pregnancy help near me"" and one of the top results seemed like a nice place, the reviews were great, the website looked great, it seemed to be what we needed - somewhere to get all the advice we need to kick off this 9-month and lifelong journey.

I called the place and the receptionist was polite and warm so I told her the situation ""we're expecting a child and we don't know what to do, we need some guidance"". In hindsight, I never gave them a chance with that statement. They booked us in for that evening, made sure to let us know they are a charitable organization not for profit so there won't be any fees. FANTASTIC!

So we showed up to the appointment that night and although the place looked kinda like a Sunday school, things seemed fine. No waiting, they saw us right away. This is great. My partner was also rather thrilled about the atmosphere and the people, plus we got free apple juice boxes. Nice!

So we met with a councillor and she had us both fill out a form, pretty basic stuff, age, sex(yes please), married/not married, basic medical history, pretty normal stuff it seemed. So we each signed and handed the form back. The councillor then told us we forgot to fill out the back page. These were the real questions, how many sexual partners do you have, do you have any STDs, have you ever had an abortion, have you decided if you wanted to keep it? Wait, what??

OK so yeah if nothing else tipped us off, surely that did... Right? Nope, we finished the form and handed it right back. This councillor didn't even read it and started showing us some things.... We got to see lifesize models of how the fetus should look right now (except that they were just fully developed babies shrunken down to various sizes), we heard some Bible verses and some interpretations of them, then the fun stuff. They showed us real photos of abortions, like high resolution images of actual abortions that belong in medical journals. Neither of us were prepared for this and my spouse nearly lost her stomach. We kinda just tried not to look fazed and we thanked the councillor for the presentation, she was sure to give us a phone number for a support line, some contact information for doctors and Midwives nearby and some church pamphlets that looked so full of Kool-aid I wanted another juice box. It was a weird experience.. At least we got a referral to a doctor and a midwife. 

That's pretty much it, I hadn't planned to post this, or for it to be this long, but now we are able have a good laugh about our own stupidity (mostly mine) and thought it made an interesting read.

tl;dr
Was surprised with a pregnancy for Christmas in 2019, googled unexpected pregnancy looking for guidance on where to begin, ended up going to a Christian anti-abortion clinic by accident.

TIFU by almost killing my grandpa and splitting up the family,t2_6lb3cjj3,"For some background context, I’m a 20 (m) trying to become a physician. Just the other day, I was going to a family gathering very social distanced for New Years with my cousins and grandparents included. Every year we do this as tradition so this year was the same (even though  I didn’t want to go but wanted to see my grandma again as she has breast cancer and won’t live much longer.) It was around 10:00 pm when dinner was finally being put on the grill and we had 4 rib eyes. Both of my grandparents are in their late 80s and are getting very weak and fragile. As the steaks were being served, we all went far apart with our families. Not 2 minutes after we started eating, my grandpa started to choke and his face was getting red. Everyone started to panic, and as someone who knows the Heimlich maneuver, I ran over trying to keep my composure. While I was running over, I tripped and knocked my grandpa out of his seat causing all the other family to panic and yell at me. At this point I was freaking out but didn’t show and I started to perform the maneuver. I got the steak out of his mouth but he couldn’t move so we called an ambulance. Earlier today I found I broke his collar bone and dislocated his spine and he is getting surgery today. All of my aunts and uncles are very mad at me and even one of my cousins came over and tried to fight me. I am currently freaking out and hoping my grandpa is gonna be alright. 

TL;DR I tripped trying to save my grandpa from choking and broke his collar bone and spine.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for the support and kind words. For those of you who are wondering, I went to the hospital this morning and both grandparents are extremely grateful. I’m told my grandpa will take a while to recover. I also got into a fight with my uncle for making my grandpa get injured. Mind you, he is roughly late 50s so I tried not to fight him that much. Once again, thank you guys for all your support!

Edit 2: I didn’t expect this to blow up! Here’s a part two to the story for those wondering what else happened. [Link Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kr0f1q/tifu_by_fighting_my_cousin_putting_him_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",1664
TIFU by investing $2000 in a giant sperm killing machine,t2_bup6j,"A few years ago my wife and I bought a house with a hot tub. We enjoyed it but after a while it developed significant issues and we found it hard to justify the expense of repairing it... we opted just to shut it down for a while. 

Well, COVID hit, and I figured that being in isolation with nothing much else to do is the best time to own a working hot tub. I tried to do the repair work myself, which took a lot of time and stress, and in the end I had to have a professional do it anyways. The process ended up costing almost $2000. But, with no vacations to budget for, we figured it was a good use of our money. 

And it was! We've been loving using the hot tub this winter. We regularly go out there for family time with our kids, who love being able to swim around a bit, and I regularly go out by myself at night to unwind. We have a beautiful park behind our yard that makes it an amazing spot to relax. Because of COVID I've been having long zoom calls with groups of friends, and realized I could do that from the comfort of my hot tub, which just amped up the enjoyment of both activities.

Concurrent to all of this though, my wife and I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to have another baby. The giant FU is that we didn't think, at any point, of the fact that hot tubs kill sperm. Last night as we were discussing our failures in the bedroom, it finally occurred to us that the hot tub might be a problem. I was disappointed, thinking “shoot I guess there will be a few days every month when I can't use it.”

Nope. We looked it up and found out that after being boiled, it takes sperm three months to ""respawn"" or whatever they have to do. 

So until I produce a winner, I am no longer allowed in my own hot tub that I slaved (and splurged) so much to repair. It took us two years to get pregnant with our previous child. Hopefully this one comes sooner.

TL;DR fixed my hot tub, boiled my future children

TIFU by being a godless heathen at a cathedral,t2_6398vitc,"Several years ago, I was in high school in a smallish town in the Midwest. I was a very edgy teen, but I usually tried my best not to draw much attention to myself or make much of a commotion- until my senior year, first period humanities class. I had a teacher who was the devil incarnate.
Mrs. Smith (name substituted for privacy) was an extremely catholic ~50 year old woman, I was a 17 year old gay and trans teen. I had never felt that much hatred and dread about a teacher, in my entire school career. She dragged on our section on Christianity and the Bible for so much of the term that every other topic. we were supposed to learn about was limited to 2 days per lesson. It was absolutely bonkers! The end of the term was nearing, and we got to our unit on period architecture, and as a wrap up activity, we took a field trip to the closest cathedral. Mrs. Smith was so thrilled about this trip, she was up to her eyeballs in holy excitement, she could not contain how important it was to her. Every class she taught, all 5 of the periods, were coming on the trip! Which meant that my best friend in her 3rd period was to come too. The day comes, and Mrs. Smith and the tour guide lead us around the (incredibly beautiful, breathtaking even) building. We stepped through the doors, and it was quiet, the whole place echoed with every noise, every shuffle, but everyone was in awe of the stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings, so they didn't have much to say yet. Except for me.

I pointed my best friend to the holy water receptical that was hollowed into one of the nearby walls, a joke I meant to be just for her.

I have never heard my voice so loud in my entire life. It bounced off of every surface in the whole place. I don’t think I have seen anyone as enraged or embarrassed as Mrs. Smith was, ever. Not in my entire life. She was absolutely fuming, she looked like she would cry or explode or maybe keel over. 

She didn't look me in the eye, for the remaining 3 weeks of the term. I became a ghost to her in that classroom, and frankly, I cannot blame her!

TLDR: Took a fieldtrip to a cathedral, and as a joke called the holy water bowl a fancy water fountain, mortifying my capital-C-Catholic teacher.",6
TIFU by dryhumping with a girl,t2_veq16,"So this happened last night and I'm feeling the consequences today. I've been talking to this girl for a little while and we went on our 2nd date yesterday. Food, photography trip and walk to the park (we're both photographers), and a random trip to target to spend my gift card money on random things I needed. It was a great time. We made it back to my house where her car was and I'm thinking she's going to head home since she works at like 7am the next morning. She wants to hangout more so we go in, meet my roommates, eventually go to my room. We play Mario kart and eventually I get her playing Celeste (awesome game btw). 

 Throughout game time we're slowly getting closer and eventually start making out. This is the turning point. She gets into it. Much more than I expected tbh. She climbs on top of me and she slowly starts grinding on my crotch area and I get into it and do it back. Eventually she pulls it out for a handy which I noticed didn't feel very good on one certain part of my penis. But like a champ I toughed it out till we were done.

 She leaves and I go to the bathroom to check out my willy. Come to find out my dick was being rubbed against my pants in a very unfortunate way to where the spot being grinded actually lost like, the top layer of skin. The spot itself was probably only like half an inch but my god it was so sensitive that even it touching my underwear sent a sharp pain. Woke up today and i cleaned it up so no infection happens or anything but it's really, really uncomfortable. 

TL;DR: First sexual experience with a girl I'm seeing ended with a small rash/scab on my dick.",66
TIFU by taking ambien,t2_8j493,"This happened last night/slash today. I took an ambien as I have done many times before. I have on times done random stuff after, like trying to cook skittles and walking around naked. This time I woke up in jail.  

I woke up this morning feeling fine but on a very uncomfortable bed. When I looked around I realized I was in a jail cell. I was super confused and then my roommate woke up and asked me to stop snoring. I was completely confused and just sat there trying to work through my memories. Last thing I remembered was taking an ambien and playing on my phone in bed. I rolled every possible scenario through my mind but couldn't remember shit after that last memory.  

Eventually a gaurd let all of us out for breakfast and I asked him why I was there, but he only knew that I was arrested for public intoxication. I didn't remember drinking so that only added to the confusion.  

I was eventually released and my dad was already waiting to pick me up. He informed me I had been acting very strange and had taken me to the hospital. After going through the ambien it was realized I had taken a dozen more later in a haze. The hospital apparently let me walk out on my own and after I tried to enter moving cars they called the police who arrested me for public intoxication. I'm so fucking embarrassed.  Could have been worse probably, though.

TL;DR Took ambien, took more while high on it, and woke up in jail.",24
TIFU helping someone,t2_yo7a9,"TIFU When I was walking out a store I witnessed an individual having a hard time loading a bbq grill (in the box) in the back of his van. When he dropped it on the ground I ran over to offer my assistance lifting it for him. The man was on a store scooter and appeared to be disabled. I just wanted to help him and continue on with my day but that wasn’t the case. As soon as I closed his back door and started walking to my vehicle a store employee yelled “hey! Did you pay for that!” Wow not cool! As I’m still walking to my vehicle, the “customer” said yes I have a receipt so I was like thank goodness. Anyways, the “customer said I’ll show you and before I got inside my vehicle, the said “customer” peeled out of the parking lot and took tf off. I couldn’t feel more horrible for thinking I might of just helped this man load something he didn’t pay for. I drove up the the employee and asked if every was ok.. yeah, it wasn’t. Police came and I game my statement. They were super cool about it and joke about how lucky I was the bbq pit was just under $400. Felony police jokes I guess. I just laughed it off covering my shame.

TL;DR: helped someone who appeared to be disabled using a store scooter lift a bbq pit into the back of his van before realizing he didn’t pay for it.",19
TIFU by accidentally posting a picture that said anal destruction in my photography classes zoom chat,t2_1zlii9oq,"Today I Fucked up by sending a bad picture to a zoom chat.  I was sending a message telling my teacher that I was late to class because my wifi was having issues.  everything is fine.  another student asks a question in the chat and being the nice person I am I go-to answer.  however I was still messaging the teacher so I sent her the message, simple mistake.  I highlight it and control c the answer and choose to send it to everyone instead of just the teacher.  for some reason, the text did not copy and sleepy I just did control v enter quickly posting the last thing I had copied before class, which was this [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/568715152514351104/791531445499592725/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/568715152514351104/791531445499592725/unknown.png)

(was sending it to a friend)

I don't realize my mistake right away and so the teacher opened it and says I assume this wasn't for me.  I said oops and asked if she could delete it.  by then a couple of people had opened it and were laughing and I was mortified. there is also apparently no way to delete any chat in zoom which is a terrible feature.  so it sat there for the rest of the class.  I'm still quite embarrassed

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR I sent a picture that said anal destruction to class chat in zoom. I or the teacher couldn't figure out how to delete it.  am still embarrassed",39
TIFU using icy hot,t2_7umnvluy,"Okay, so my girlfriend got me some icy hot just yesterday for some shoulder pain I was having. Used it the other night and it worked well!

(Sidenote: I never really use over the counter medicine, like ever, which includes topical creams and such.) I was actually very impressed with how well it was helping my shoulder/neck area. Today was the day that icy hot would FU my day.

I did a lot of heavy lifting/walking so my knees started feeling kind of sore. Gf decided to rub on some icy hot (nice and thick too lol) all around my knees and at first you'd think ""Ooh nice cooling sensation. Ah, relaxing heat."" For me, it was more of a ""THIS F*CKING BURNS SO MUCH MORE THAN YESTERDAY."" So I kept trying to sleep and just could not stand the searing pain anymore. 

Turns out what I was experiencing was a chemical burn which apparently is kind of rare but can happen to some people. 🤗


TLDR: Used icy hot on my knees, burned like hell and irritated my skin (it was a chemical burn). Washed it off super quickly, never using it again lol.",8
TIFU By Cumming On My Cat,t2_6i84c345,"So for context. I was sitting in my room about over a month ago. I had buildup of stress n shit and had to bust a nut. So me being the horny teen I am, I load some nice content and start wacking. At this point my cat had just came into my room to lay down. He is sitting over across the room about 3 to 4 1/2 ft away. Something about today was just stressful. I had just finished a 3week no fap period. 

So here I am willy in hand and I'm edging. So come about a good 6 munites later, I'm already ready to blow. So this would be my 4th organism and I go to stop the nerve signal to my willy to make it shoot cream. Except this time I'm too weak. I only managed to block off the flow. So here I am now shaking and right when I let off the point of pressure. I shot like a fucking rocket spewing thick heavy strings of cum


And I fall backwards due to the amount of release and intensity of this. I remember laying up to see I had hit my wall that was 5 ft away and looked down to see my cat had been in the line of fire... So I had to clean everything and the cat. The worst part wasn't cumming on him. It was having to give him a fucking bath and getting clawed the crap outta. 


But that was my fuckup I was too embarrassed to share. So I am now.

TL/DR 
I finished 3 weeks of no fap and needed to bust. I wasn't able to move my cat out of the line of the fire and had to suffer the responsibility of bathing him",18
Tifu by laughing at sausage,t2_5oru0lwv,"Today, my dad and I decided to go to chilies, the finest dining in all of the land. Everything was just fine. The water tasted like unwashed balls, fried pickles greasy, all in all a good experience so far.

Then the waiter arrives once more...

I being the wonderful man I am let my dad order his fine dining first, the smokehouse combo which happened to include sausage. The waiter says “ahh yeah it’s really good especially the sausage”. I, having the mind and humor of a two year old starting laughing. 

This was no ordinary laughter, I was crying laughing. I was laughing so hard I was crying just because the waiter said he liked the sausage. Since I was laughing uncontrollably I attracted the attention of neighboring tables and seemed like a psychopath. 

Turns out the sausage was pretty good. 

Tl:dr (I guess) I laughed uncontrollably because the waiter said he liked the sausage",13
TIFU by accidentally texting my co-worker that he was going to be fired.. and celebrating it.,t2_17k60e,"This happened two years ago while working my first job out of college. I just recently thought about how fucking awful (hilarious) this was and wanted to share.

Myself along with about 5 friends from college all landed the same entry level sales role with a startup tech company in the Bay Area. We were all from the Midwest so working together at a start up in California was super cool. We had happy hours on the beach almost everyday; we were broke, post grads living on the west coast. 

We made some friends that were locals, and all around our age. Majority easy going, motivated young professionals trying to make a name for ourselves. Except for this damn new kid.

At about 8 months into the job, one of our friends, Johnny, made his way to a team lead position- so he was now essentially on the way to becoming a manager &amp; sort of helping out the new hires.

Shortly after securing his first promotion, team lead of about 30 entry level sales folks, our 45 year old manager was suddenly fired. 

This made way for the possibility of Johnny (24 year old), our good friend to become our direct manager.. Sort of awesome, and sort of very awkward.

After a couple weeks of our director being indecisive about whether to have Johnny be the manager of essentially his 30 friends.. the decision was final. Johnny is now our manager.

Back to this new kid - we’ll call him Chad. Chad was born and raised in California, a bit different than the majority of our friends we had met that had moved in from out of state for the job. Chad loved to talk about his daddy’s money, Cars, numerous homes, and would leave work early (starting the first week of the job) to play golf. 

He found ways to cheat at work, constantly hit on the very few women at the company, took advantage of having a young friendly manager, and all around became pretty well hated amongst our team. 

Everyone wanted Chad fired. I was essentially begging Johnny to fire him as I couldn’t stand him, knew he didn’t need the money, and just all around didn’t think he deserved the job.

One morning (we had to get to work at 5:30am working east coast hours) Johnny pulls me into a room and tells me he got approval to let go of Chad. I was fucking ecstatic! I didn’t have to deal with this fucking guy any longer, he was going to be fired in a couple hours. Johnny made sure to tell me not to tell a soul and this was between us, he couldn’t hold it in and not tell me because he knew I’d be stoked.

I rushed back to my desk, went to text my co-worker the great news: I typed - “Dude Chad is getting fired today hahaha thank fuck” 

I texted it to Chad.. he comes over to my desk, showing me my text message, on his phone, with watery eyes. I had no idea what to do, I nervously laughed and said “I mean it is what it is man, you wanna go talk it out?” 

He says “no, Johnny we need to talk, with his voice quivering holding back tears”

They leave the room and I instantly feel awful, know that now my job and Johnny job are on the line.

Chad wasn’t fired because HR got involved and felt bad for him. I had numerous meetings with HR and my director. Chad left on his own, and got a better job a few months later. After MONTHS of awkwardly passing him in the hallway &amp; not speaking to anyone.

I was almost fired, along with Johnny for the way we handled the situation. That was Johnny first month as a manager. Johnny is still a a manger there today. I left a couple months later for a competitor. 

I still hate Chad but feel awful for how that went down. I also quadruple check who the recipient is that I am texting whenever I am talking shit. 

TL;DR: My friend was my manager and let me know he was going to fire this kid the whole company hated (Chad). When I got the news, I texted Chad accidentally and said “Dude Chad is getting fired today hahaha thank fuck” and almost lost my job while he kept his",9
TIFU by almost getting my self and my friend killed and my dad arrested for murder,t2_5zdz56ww,"(TLDR at the bottom) This didn’t happens today but I’m still gonna tell the story;

so when my buddy Lucas (not his real name)and i where around 17-18 we where really into hunting rabbits, at first we hunted with air rifles because I live in a farm which is 20 meters from town and people used to call the cops every time we used a shotgun, but we weren’t catching anything cause pellets aren’t good for hunting (we where broke and hunting with a 200€ rifle and 2€ pellets). 

        We started making traps and in fact they worked great, the thing is that my family has a dairy farm with around 100 cows (at the time), so every bad smell was attributed to us even though they came from the water treatment facility and the local pig slaughterhouse or every person who also has animals here, but people always said it was us even though we have all the permits and a “poop management system”.
basically if you stand 100 meters in front of the barn you won’t smell anything.
We’ve invited the local authorities and sanitary services to our farm to prove the smell wasn’t from our farm and they all seem to say that’s it’s nothing wrong with us and that neighbors are just assholes.
All of ur neighbors live at least 300 meters away from us, and the nearest house is 500 meters away from the barn so there’s no way they get any hint of smell from us.

One day things changed, there’s always been legends about us, the most of them where about my grandpa who was a ww2 German soldier who moved and became the first forestal engineer in my country, when he retired he built his farm.

There where many legends about my grandpa like that he had a contract with the devil because everything that he planted grew (it was because he used fertilizer) or that we had a snake hatchery and that we fed them with calves, that his dogs where a gift of the devil himself etc...

A day like any other my dad received a letter that said that the neighbors of saruca (the street next to our farm) where suing us and and the cause was: (it actually said this)  “they kill old cows and calves to feed their snakes”, my dad was livid, he couldn’t believe how stupid this was, at first he thought it was some kind of joke so he called the town hall to verify that this was legit and it was.

Some rumors started spreading and people started trespassing to search for proof of our ungodly behavior (obviously they didn’t find anything) so they placed cow and calf bones and killed pigs on our land to make it look like it was true (we don’t even have pigs) and when they couldn’t prove anything people decided to start threatening us, because of this my dad had to shoot a few people who trespassed (he made special shotgun cartridges with sea salt so it’s not lethal but it sure burns like hell and leave a easily recognizable mark on the skin) 

One day I was talking to my dad and he told me how much of a pest rabbits are and that I should hunt them, sooo....I did,  I called Lucas and told him what I wanted to do and before I could ask him he said yes.
The thing is that I forgot to tell my dad what we where about to do, Biiiiiiig  mistake, so at 8-9pm we started setting up our traps and we knew we needed to be quick to check them, otherwise stray and our neighbors dogs might get them first, so Lucas stayed at the farm and around 5:30 we took my truck and went to check the traps.

The milkman, who arrives at that time saw a truck wandering the farm and called my dad, he took one of his shotguns and went to check the wandering truck, we were checking the traps we left on the forest and suddenly I notice him because of the rear lights of his truck and called him;

Me: hey dad what are you doing here ? 
 
Dad: what ? Is that you ? WHAT THE FUCK ATE YOU DOING HERE  !?!?!?!?

Me: we are hunting rabbits like you told me 

Dad: ARE YOU NUTSS!?!?!? WHY DIDN’T YOU TOLD ME !?!?!? IF YOU HADN’t CALLED ME I WOUL HAVE SHOT YOU TWO 

Dad: Jesus Christ..., go home AND NEVER PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN, YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME WHAT YOU WHERE DOING !!!!!!

So we went home and I knew I screwed up and that we could have been shot with those salt cartridges, the think is that later That day out of curiosity I checked his shotgun to see how salt cartridges where and I found out that he wasn’t carrying the non lethal ones, they were real cartridges , that’s when I realized that if I hadn’t called him we would probably be dead and my dad in jail for murder 


TLDR: 
My Friend and I went hunting with traps and almost got killed by my dad while checking them when he showed to investigate a wandering vehicle on his farm",20
TIFU by sending extremely passive aggressive messages to my sister after she left for college without saying bye.,t2_4m9gluuy,"Ok so some context. This happened hours ago, my sister's Winter break is over so she went back to college today right? Well I helped her with her stuff and then said I was gonna use the bathroom, expecting to see her outside and say goodbye to her. My mom texts me saying she parked across the street and I go out only to see she isn't there.

So I get in the car and we wait. Turns out according to mom she came down and didn't come out. Mind you, she has a boyfriend who she obviously gives all her attention to (no joke she talks to him 24/7 but not to us) and up and left. Me, my mom, and my stepdad, we were all upset at her.

Later on, come nightfall it was dinner time and I got too pissed and messaged her an extremely passive aggressive message. I sent:

""Heyo (sister's name), just wanna let you know we're all upset that you didn't say bye to us and just ghosted us cuz of your boyfriend but y'know it's whatever! I hope your phone actually ""works"" this time with us and not just with your boyfriend!😃😄""

Yeah, big mistake. She got ticked and I went back and forth saying ""Riiiight but I bet if it was (sister's boyfriend's name) you would've received it huh?"" (This was after I told her mom did call her and she ignored us... again.)

This lead to me sending a screenshot as evidence of the fact that mom DID call her saying ""Bullshit! You didn't call us but mom did!""

Side note, I'm 14, she is 21. I rarely curse to her (only when I quote some dumb meme or a thing my friend said). I have NEVER cursed at her in spite. Today was the first.

Of course, she got upset, and said not to curse at her (although, if I'm extremely upset at you and I feel it's appropriate obviously I'll curse. I won't give people respect if they do something like that. Especially if they're a family member).

She then claimed she was in her room thinking I'd come back (mom and I had a feeling she'd say that) and then I said ""Mom and I had a feeling you were gonna pull the ""I was in my room"" card.""

And things sorta went from there, with my last message to her being ""But ya know it iz what it izzz! Right?😃""

Later on mom got a call from sis's boyfriend and sis was on the line. I overheard it all. She was crying and when mom put me on the phone to talk to her sis said (without me knowing I was on the line) in her tearful voice: ""I don't want to talk to her right now.""

**That hurt. Really badly. I somehow made my 21 year old sister cry. And I felt so terrible. I still do. I couldn't eat the rest of my dinner.**

And here I am! 12:33 AM and typing away all of this and fuck I feel terrible. She's gonna call this weekend supposedly but eh I dunno.

TLDR: My sister went back to college without saying goodbye and I ended up coming at her through texts and making her cry because I was so passive aggressive.",9
TIFU by not checking my hot sauce,t2_fa03d,"This happened an hour or so ago.

My husband and I recently started enjoy Pho. We've only made instant stuff at home. Once that ran out, I looked up some recipes and noticed we already had many of the ingredients, so after picking up some rice noodles, I headed home to cook faux-pho for dinner.

I get the broth going, adding onion, ginger, etc. Its time to add the hot sauce. I pull the bottle of Sriracha, twist open the cap, and give it a light squeeze.

Plop went the cap along with about a fifth of the bottle of the spiciest sauce I feel comfortable eating. Im not making a whole lot of soup, mind you. Just enough for about one ladle of broth each for my husband and I.

I dilute it a bit with water. Doesn't help. I add some more. Not helping. I've now made twice as much broth as I was intending and its still more spice than flavor. I can't dilute it more because I don't have enough onion and garlic to make up for the flavor.

""Fuck it, we can tolerate it."" - some of the whitest, blandest people you will ever meet. 

We get a few bites in and start crying from pain. I go to wipe my tears away. That's how I found out I had not washed the sauce off my hands properly.

So now my eyes hurt, our mouths hurt, and in the morning our buttholes are going to hurt, and not in the fun way. 

TL:DR; unexpected Sriracha floods my dinner and soon my bowls.",17
TIFU By almost sledding straight into a tree only to be “saved”... by children,t2_50ysg9cw,"
Happened 2 years ago. I was 24m then. My family went on a little snow day trip to an area just under bear mountain in California. Like, the ghetto area that’s free with sludgy snow. 

I’m not a snow person, I live in sunny soCal, but I know this area had that really bad type of snow that’s not fun to play with and definitely not fun to sled on.

This little free ghetto area had some trash can lids that other people left behind. It wasn’t a ‘bring your own sled’ type of deal, everyone here seemed to not mind sharing.

People were taking turns sledding casually on what was essentially hard ice from the Middle of the hill. But my turn came up, and the genius that I am thought, “why isn’t anyone sledding from atop of this 50ft hill? Looks way more fun from up there!”

I went up there and felt bolder (stupider) than everyone else. This was surely going to be fun. 
I sled... fast. I had absolutely no control and was heading straight for a huge tree...until I slammed into 2 little kids. Both probably around 10 years old.

Their little bodies probably saved my life. 

One boy and one girl. The boy kind of ricocheted from the impact but the girl took the full blunt of my 160lbs body. I didn’t know these kids or their family at all. The parents were mad. My family calmed them saying it was just an accident and that everyone was fine, just some bruising (despite the little girl uncontrollably crying.) 

I felt so bad, I pretty much ruined another family’s ghetto snow day, but all I can think about was that these 2 kids’ frail bodies saved me from sledding head first into a tree, and I was kind of thankful for that.

Tldr: I decided to sled from atop a giant hill. Came crashing into children. But I felt thankful because they saved me from hitting a tree.",25
TIFU by getting back into bed the wrong way,t2_xyogjp0,"This literally just happened, and it just shows my partner truly loves me.

A bit of background, I have borderline personality disorder, and when I have an episode/flare up, I won't let my partner touch me. This often means that I'll lay in bed funny, ie head at the bottom of the bed, rather than where the pillows are.

This morning, I got up to put on breakfast, and then went back to bed while I wait for it to cook because it's cold. Not wanting to risk falling back to sleep, I started off sitting up with the duvet around my shoulders, but that started to hurt, so I layed down and continued my reddit browsing.

My partner suddenly sits up and calls my name, asking what I'm doing. He's just woken up, so has no context, other than, I'm in a position that might indicate an episode, and he went straight to ""talk her round"" mode.

TLDR: didn't wanna fall back to sleep, ended up worrying my partner that I was having a mental health crisis by not having my head on the pillows.

PS I did immediately sit up and go ""I'm okay"" and explain when it clicked what he was thinking",231
TIFU by asking my fellow campers to masterbate together.,t2_490pjokv,"This happened about six or so years ago. I was at a summer aquatic's camp. Our Camp counselors had decided that we would all play a game together. I don't remember the name of the game, but it was in the same vain as Mafia or Among us. One of us kids was a killer and we needed to find out who it was. Being the eloquent genius that I am, I decided that I should speak up and say something witty. 

""We need to come together and contemplate!"" 

Well, that's what I had meant to say. Instead I decided to say ""We need to come together and masturbate!"" I had assumed that masturbate was a similar word to contemplate except for one key difference. Those who masterbate are masters. 

My flawed logic lead me to horrify the adult camp counselors and embarrass myself.


TL;DR: I said the word masturbate instead of contemplate during a camping game and made a fool of myself at age 11.",53

I needed a phone charger because my phone was dead, and I couldn’t find my charger, so I went to my brother to ask if he had a spare one.

TIFU by hitting a woman and wrecking the car i'm driving,t2_25n5wa4v,"As usual it was not today but a few months ago. I was learning to get my driving license and it was a practice session with my teacher riding in shotgun. Everything was normal as I got a pretty good sense of the car. Stopped at an intersection and this is where I fucked up. On the bike lanes there were many motorbike riders but I didn't see anyone so I thought nothing of it and stepped on the gas. Bang, I hit something and the car stalled. Luckily I remembered to press hazard light and e-brake. As we got out, we saw a woman with her motorbike at the front corner of our car. Apparently she was in my blind spot and was a little bit too close to my lane. Luckily tho she was not hurt although my tire popped beyond repair.  
TLDR: didn't check blindspot at intersection and hitting a motorbike, damaging the driving school's car and my ego in one move. No human hurt in the making of this FU",3
Tifu (really like last year I fucked up and admitted it to my girlfriend today),t2_7cagzcpe,"Little background to paint the picture.
24, used to have a pretty good job. (Pay wise) quit because I'd rather neck myself than torture myself for dollars.

Started trading stocks and turned a few hundo into over 60k. Legit. I felt like the fucking goat.

Girlfriend and I had a rough start but year 2 was going great

And that's really all the prologue needs.

Quit good job in December last year mainly to spend Christmas with the family and find another job, found one, worked legit 26 hours straight once. Fairly certain it's not legal but in long story if I didn't drive to Baltimore (6 hours each way) to get supplies for the shop, to make the food, and sell the food, we wouldn't be open at all that week because the manager was a fuck up and I saved her entire career. I got her fired too cause fuck her but that was later.
Started consuming recreational Marijuanas. Tried it but never stuck. Magically I went from 0 smoking to awoken and tokin' 24/7. Quit the store. Stonks doing good, gf laid off from covid, I thought I was Jordan Belfort junior up in this shit. Making hundreds a day sometimes, between the copious amount of pot, spending every day off with my girl and seeing those stonks I felt invincible and I started putting off bills because I could just float till next week so I can do whatever this week.

Lost all my potential stock gains in like 1.5 days.
Negative 4k on robinhood (long story)
Maxed cards.
Other personal debt.
Continue to hide it from everyone around me. And let it build up.

Opened the water bill today. 980$ I've put it off all year. On top of my other fuck ups and losing over 60k in potential gains. I really do feel like offing myself. I started crying in the bathroom tonight when I knew I cant pay our rent this month or really anything. I've got enough for food but if I buy food there's no money left. 


And now that it came crashing down and I lost it all it now means that instead of ""using the cash for rent for something else and using my money to pay the rent"" I officially am a person who spent all my friends money on drugs, all my girlfriends money on drugs, and I lost every dollar I had.

*But wait theres more*

I knew what I was doing. I watched the descent. I'm a very intelligent person. I'm great at stepping out and looking at myself. No one is harder on me than me. But this year I slipped. I've been so lucky, plus using my witts to hustle I've never struggled. Not in school, not at work. I mean fuck, honestly looking back I would've called myself a God.

And tonight I humbley admit, and would like to claim the throne as the world's biggest fuck up, and reddit biggest retard. And that includes all those r/wallastreetbets retards too. I declare myself king. 

Because I KNEW I was doing it. And told myself I'd be okay. As opposed to people who are ignorant. At least they genuinely didn't know better. They may be stupid but I my friends... am a different breed. 

I don't need any anti suicide posts. I 98.72% (made that shit up) won't neck myself. But if I do, I'll go out like a fucking king by slamming my car into a wall revbanging that bitch since the car is all I have left. As of now my girlfriend is staying but I've lied to her this entire journey. I didn't even tell her about the 60k in gains untill tonight because instead of cashing out I got greedy. And I knew it.

Tldr. Ya boi done fucked his life and im in enough debt to buy a small house at 24. And now I can't can't afford drugs to cope (let's be real I shouldn't. I know that, but at this point I'm stupid enough to throw my life away)

Yabadaba doo I'm out of here

Edit. I want to change the ending of my speech to 

**thanks for coming to my ted talk**

Edit number 2. Sometime the world tells you not to give in. I went for a drive to clear my head, pulled into wawa for gas and food and a kid rolls up to me and compliments my car (I got them cosmic purple wheels always catching looks) and I kinda jokingly told him how fucked I was since we had been shooting the shit by the gas pump for a few minutes and he told me I can work at dominos with him, he'll give me the job as long as the manager can waive my reckless (2.5 years ago) and you know, dominos might not be the best job to recover but it's a fuckin start.
Also please everyone who reads this, while I have a sense of humor  about it, please invest responsibly and take care of yourselves. Also, never give up.",6
TIFU by having my bestfriend sleep over,t2_2ttcbarh,"Obligatory this didn’t happen today but 3 nights ago.

Sorry if this breaks any rules.

Information:
My bestfriend (F17) and I (M17) have been best friends for over a year now since we have a lot of classes together and just instantly got along. During this time we’ve both had feelings for one another but nothing ever came from it since we were in other relationships. But when we were both single we tried it out, we both were so happy and had a lot of fun, but decided it would be best just to remain friends to not ruin the strong friendship we had.

3 months ago she started to like this guy and vice versa. They went on several dates but since they are both very shy and scared of rejection, they never asked eachother out or went for a kiss. They text eachother 24/7 and she has practically half his wardrobe. Over the past month he has been away visiting family, but he’s always been jealous of me so my bestfriend always has to lie to him when we hangout so he doesn’t have to worry. Since they started talking I haven’t tried anything with her so there shouldn’t be a reason he should be worried. 


So to the story. 
Three nights ago our mutual friend hosted her going away dinner the night before she left. Wanting to make the most of it, my bestfriend and her asked if they could sleep over at my place. Before this no girls have ever slept over at my place because of a strict but loving mum, but to our amazed mum said yes. 

So after the dinner they both come back to mine where we end up watching ‘Us’. During the movie the three of us sit on the couch with the mutual friend on the end, my best friend in the middle and me on the other end. Like several times before my bestfriend rests her head on my shoulder. As the movie progresses and starts getting scarier, to my dismay we started holding hands, then hand on her thigh to my arms around her and finally to cuddling. This is completely shocking to me since all she talks about is her crush and how when he gets back they’ll start dating, but I definitely am not complaining since she is absolutely stunning. 

The movie finishes around 1am where the mutual friend decides to go to bed. So I offer her if she wants to go to sleep in my bed whilst my bestfriend and I continue on to a second movie and she agrees. 

Whilst the second movie starts we start flirting hard which eventually leads to kissing. The two of us end up making out for over an hour which is the most passionate and amazing time I’ve ever had. The kissing leads to other stuff until she asks if I want to have sex. But the problem was that I didn’t have any condoms since my ex was on birth control and had the implant. But thankfully she says “don’t you think a woman comes prepared” and hurry’s off to get them from my bedroom without waking our mutual friend up. The combination of the nerves and it being 3:30 in the morning, I couldn’t get it up. She was totally cool about it and understanding where at 4am we both went to bed, she slept in my bed with the mutual friend whilst I slept on the floor. 

This is where the fuck up happens. I knew the kissing and flirting and everything was a one off but I had caught feelings. It was so hard not to, with the constant affection for hours and just her being amazing it was inevitable. Although I was happy to go along and continue with it, I just felt used and hurt. I knew nothing would happen between us because how much she likes her soon to be boyfriend but somehow the smallest bit of me has caught feelings. 

TL;DR:
My bestfriend stayed over the night where we hooked up but I had caught feelings whilst she likes another guy.",3
TIFU picking a stupid fight,t2_9obxnu5m,"
So hi, this is my first post, sorry if I’m doing it wrong. Lol. 
So on New Years Day I had my friend over, we will call him Blue Cheese. Anyway, this is my best friend, one of two friends (but also I’m kind of in love with him because of another TIFU, it’s super lame). Well, we got in a fight, and I ended up telling Blue Cheese I didn’t want to be friends anymore and to get his stuff out of my house. And then he did. And I was really broken up about it. I guess I expected him to console me even though he was also upset and ignore my childishness? 

Then I fucked up some more and sent long ass texts pouring my heart out to him to receive nothing in return. 

On some level I expect him to feel things for me because I feel things for him which is not fair

But on the other hand we used to hang out almost every day and he was really important in my life. And i didn’t think it would be that easy for him to lose me. I mean I have witnessed this guy get harassed and threatened by one of his drunk friends and still reach out to them the next day. It’s hard knowing we are not the friends I thought we were. 

Also I broke my phone.

And then on top of everything when I sent my message to end all messages my phone went out and now I got the new phone and he probably never responded but now I’ll never know for sure. But TIFU is one of his favorite subreddits so maybe he will see this and reach out? 

TL:DR, I was being petty and immature and I lost my best friend. I just want my Blue Cheese back.",6
TIFU by choosing today to protest the underpayment and bad treatment of dance teachers,t2_6ii7mzi4,"Hi, I am a professional dance teacher, and so are most of my family. I feel strongly about the benefits that the arts have on people, on their physical and their mental health, for example.

However, we are frequently underfunded and disrespected, especially those of us who actually teach dance and further the art form by passing it on to students. I felt today would be a good day to go to protest outside of Congress about how we are disrespected and our poor pay.

When I posted about this protest on Twitter, I only got two retweets, and one of them was from my son, so I assumed that it'd be quiet. But then all these dancers showed up to protests, and then we were breaking into the Senate, and then I realized the truth- they weren't dancers at all.

Now there's riot police around me and I think I saw the FBI a few minutes ago, and people on Twitter think this whole protest is just people who love Trump, but I've never even voted, I just wanted to make people happy through the movement of my body. Anyway, now I'm involved in an insurrection against the government, and I think I made a big mistake.

TL;DR- I accidentally joined a violent protest when I just wanted to make people dance",0
TIFU by dropping the remote in my hospital room,t2_4lrl4ps2,"This happened about 3 months ago when I was in the hospital after having open heart surgery to replace my aortic valve (thanks, congenital defect!) 

Anyway, I had just been moved to a step down unit after being in the ICU for 5 morphine filled days. In the ICU someone was looking in on me constantly, but in the cardiac step down I was finally going to get a little peace! It was around 2 am and my nurse said she wouldn’t have to come back until 6am. “Just push the call button on the remote if you need me,” she said. Me, excited about getting a little sleep, but still wired, turned on the TV for what I thought would be a soothing 15 mins or so. 

TV is on Comedy Central, about 3 or 4 clicks too loud. I go to turn the volume down, and the damned remote slips out of my hand and hits the floor. South Park is now playing annoyingly loud and the 11 inch incision down the center of my chest is not yet allowing me to get out of bed on my own. I tried fishing it back with a pillowcase to no avail. I’m literally trying to MacGyver anything on my tray table to make Cartman stfu so I can sleep. Maybe I can reach? My recently wired-together sternum quickly puts that attempt to rest. 

Oh yeah, there’s a call button on the bed itself! Yes!! Well, shit. It’s apparently not hooked up. 

4 episodes of loud ass South Park roll by. 4! And they all center around the 2016 election. Kill. Me. Now. I could start yelling I guess, but I’m not in any danger. Being annoyed and sleepy sucks but it’s not worth being dramatic over, right? Wait...something else is coming on. Thank God!!

IT’S A FUCKING HOURLONG ADAM &amp; EVE SEX TOY INFOMERCIAL. This woman is going into a lot of details that I’m not in the mood for. Now Tom Selleck is trying to sell me on a reverse mortgage! Loudly! Make it stop! Now it’s Medicare Advantage plans!!

Finally my dear nurse walks in and says “still up? I figured you’d want to get some rest.” 🤦‍♂️

TL;DR Dropped my remote after recovering from open heart surgery and had to listen to loud ass South Park episodes/a woman trying to sell dildos/Magnum PI selling reverse mortgages, etc until my nurse finally saved me.",420
TIFU by copy pasting NSFW text in my presentation slide,t2_80anmt0e,"This happened just last week. So, I had a meeting with my boss and the clients I have in my company. I was just browsing through Omegle and having fun video chatting with random strangers before the meeting. It's so hard to type in the chat box so I had a NSFW template ready to paste and send. For some reason I pasted that phrase in my presentation just before my meeting and when the time of meeting came, I started sharing my screen. And there it was on 12 pt Calibri NSFW text seeing through my hell and embarrassing me. I quickly stopped sharing it and then deleted it and proceeded with the meeting. I just hope the boss didn't see it and doesn't fire me for this.

TL;DR - Shared a NSFW text in my presentation with my clients and quickly stopped sharing the content.",17
TIFU by letting my mom watch unholy anime,t2_6ytcy97j,"First of all, I'm sorry for my bad english.

This happened a while ago, back in september 2020. One day, I decided to watch an anime movie called Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel II. I've watched several animes from the Fate franchise, most of them in the living room's TV, it didn't contain things like nudity, just a bit of violence. So it was gonna be alright this time too, right?

Right?

I donwloaded the movie and started watching it on the TV. My parents were working from home, but I didn't think it was that big of deal. Thirty minutes into the anime, things started getting a little...weird. I started questioning if this was a good ideia. Then, one of the characters start undressing. And after this, there is the sex scene.

And of course my mom would appear in that exact moment. Not in any of the amazing fight scenes, nooooo. It had to be in the god damn sex scene.

So my mom almost didn't let me watch anime anymore, if it wasn't for my dad, he didn't make a big deal out of it. But yeah, my mom still gives me that disgusted look when I'm watching anything.

I didn't really fuck up things that bad, just wanted to share this story with you. Besides this little incident, it's a great movie, can't wait for the sequel!

TL;DR: My mother saw me watching a sex scene in an anime movie",14
tifu by triggering myself,t2_21yuxz92,"tw: depression, vague cr*otic mention

this happened just now.

it's 4:45 am and i (20f) haven't slept. i usually am able to fall asleep to calming music so i figured i would try it again. i remembered that there was this beautiful song i used to listen to and how it always calmed 
me. like any normal person, i decided to look up the song again.

however, i forgot that this song is from a video game that my ex-favorite youtuber played through. i watched this youtuber religiously throughout middle school and bonded with my ex-best friend over him. this all happened when i first started showing signs of depression and suicidal thinking. it doesn't help that this song is literally a cry asking why things need to change. 

all of this hits me at once and now i'm sobbing like a little bitch.

tldr: unknowingly triggered myself with a song that i have a deep emotional connection with.",2
TIFU by being too reliant on my Google pixel 3XL and showing my dad's friend a cherry pink soft silicone dildo.,t2_3fo9fkox,"This mortification actually happened today, I know, unfuckingbelievable.

Last week I encountered a small problem with electricity at my house, And my dad have a friend who's an electrician, so he offered to help me over zoom with a discount. 

I took all the pictures of the cables and electricity box, and the magic alien genies that create all the energy I used to power my house.

Then I opened up my Google photos on my computer where I had zoom open, and screen shared my Google photos so he can see them.

This is the part where I am a fucking diabolical idiot.

Last night, I had screenshotted a dildo I kind of want to get, as a small reminder.

Turns out that was a really successful move, since I'm going to remember it till I die.

Right before the meeting, when I took all the photos as needed, I archived the dildo screenshot, so it won't show up on my photos, and unless I specifically go to a folder and open it. 

My Google pixel phone have the Google photos app, and it automatically syncs to my computer.

I love this phone, and I swear this is not a commercial.

I screenshared all the electricity stuff I don't understand, and he asked me to scroll back to see the first photo again, and like the  dumb idiot with 5 thumbs on each hand, I accidentally scrolled up too far.

I only archived the photos about a minute ago, and today, it didn't load yet on my computer. It was still in my photos gallery, not in a private folder

When that showed up on screen, I was in shock, and it took me like at least 3 seconds to go back, And I'm pretty sure he saw it too.

Because he asked me: ""did you need me to help fix that too? Because it looks like it's battery operated, you don't need to plug it in to any outlets right.""

My cheeks were just as pink as the dildo, And I asked him a quick question on some dumb cables, And he chuckled and answered them.

And now let me share my embarrassment with all of you adorable goofballs, laugh ahead.

Tl;dr: I accidentally showed my dad's friend a dildo",21
TIFU by accidentally laughing as the misfortune of an ex-coworker,t2_4516kcdh,"Happened a few years back but still feel like a complete peen about it to this day.
 
So I pulled up at work one day and started heading across the car park when I saw one of the new staff members (she'd been there a month-ish) Heading back to her car. It was 9am so I was confused why she was walking away from work, not towards it.

Being silly and friendly I shout across to her ""yo, why you walking that way? Work's in the opposite direction!"" To which she replies ""I've just been fired.."" in a seemingly jokey tone. Joking about getting fired was also weirdly common where I worked too

Thinking she cant possibly be serious, I yell back ""haha, GOOD! see ya later dick head!""  Whilst waving my middle finger proudly in the air and grinning from ear to ear like an inflatable tube man.


10 minutes into my shift I'm told by a friend that she was in fact NOT joking and absolutely had been fired. This was a job she had told me she was excited about as it was big career change for her but she unfortunately didn't make it through probation...
This poor girl had stuck her neck out trying something new then basically been told she wasn't good enough, then my stupid ass cheerily rubbed salt into a very fresh wound.

I never saw her again and me calling her names, giving her the finger and exclaiming my joy at her dismissal will forever be her last memory of that job.




Tl;Dr new staff member told me she was fired and I thought she was joking. I laughed, shouted GOOD at her then gave her the finger before finding out she actually had bee fired.",74
TIFU by thinking my teacher was Tom Brady's mom.,t2_247j5l8y," Obligatory, this didn't happen today, it happened years ago actually.

This happened back in 2011, when I was just 7. As a young sports fan in Rhode Island who was starting to get to know his local sports teams (Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox, etc). My first day of school was in August, and I was one of those kids who had to stay in an extended day program where you hang out with teachers until your parents pick you up. My parents didn't neglect me or anything like that, it was because of their jobs and they didn't want me taking a school bus. One of the teachers who ran the program was an old woman named Mrs. Brady. So when I first met her, I was convinced she was Tom Brady's mother, because, well, same last name and I didn't know any better at the time. I didn't bother to ask, I was just convinced. In October, our school hosted a Halloween party, and Mrs. Brady said she was bringing her son. I was thinking in my mind, ""oh my goodness, I'm about to meet Tom Brady!""

Fast forward to the Halloween party, and I came in with my hopes up. I saw Mrs. Brady, and she pointed out her son, throwing around a football. I was totally thinking, ""oh my God! It's Tom Brady!"" Thank God I didn't say it out loud, because...

It wasn't Tom Brady. His name wasn't even Tom. I don't remember his real name, but I was disappointed.

TL;DR I was convinced my teacher was Tom Brady's mom, and when I met her son I was disappointed to see it wasn't him.",17
TIFU by Downloading Minecraft Mods on My Chromebook,t2_8kzorfr6,"So I'm a gamer. A budget gamer. My parents aren't poor by any means, we are actually pretty well off, but we have to be frugal. If I want a sixty-dollar videogame, I have to buy it myself. Since I don't have a job, obviously I can't get a six-thousand dollar gaming PC, I have to rely on either christmas gifts, hand-me-downs, or birthday presents. My mom is a doctor, and regularly buys electronics for her practice. Once in a while, she will bring home a crappy PC or some other old electronic that she bought an upgrade for. This is how I got my eight-year-old Ipad pro that I like to draw on.

One day, my mom brought home an old PC. I used this chance to finally get Minecraft Java (I had only played Minecraft on my phone.) The PC was s\*\*\*, so it was VERY slow, and little kid me quickly infested the poor thing with adware, and a horrible virus that sent me nudes of random women. (Don't worry I'm a girl.)

Fast forwards a few years, and I was going to a new school. A new school that made laptops mandatory for schoolwork. I was excited, because it would be the first time I would get my own personal private computar.

When we were at Best Buy, I looked at all the cool computers that ran mostly Windows. But my parents wanted me to get a Chromebook. Back then, I knew nothing about Chromebooks, so I didn't know the thing we had just bought for $300 dollars was a total piece of s\*\*\*.

I got home and logged into all my accounts. I wanted to play something on Steam, so I tried to get one of the free games. I was unsuccessful. You can't get games on Chromebooks unless you do some complex stuff on Linux, an extension that comes with every Chromebook.

A few months later, and I was fed up. I looked through YouTube for ways to get games on a Chromebook. Specifically Minecraft. To my delight, there were a couple people talking about the subject, and I chose the video with the most views. I ran Linux, put in all the commands needed, and I was legitimately surprised when the Minecraft launcher worked, and I was directed to Minecraft's title screen. No issue.

For the next few months, I happily played Minecraft. I built a cool amusement park, and was starting a massive minecraft city I had in my head. I also had a survival world, but I didn't play it often, because the game would crash regularly, and I had to go to the setting to set a bunch of things to the lowest setting. Like the graphics and render distance. I think it was because since all of my creative worlds were on superflat, those had an easier time loading chunks in.

I was soon unsatisfied. I should have stayed unsatisfied. I wanted mods on my minecraft worlds. BAD F\*\*\*\*\*\* IDEA. The same guy I had learned to download minecraft from had posted another video about how to download mods on a Chromebook. I followed all the steps like last time, and it worked. I spent hours downloading mods and trying them out. I even created a survival world full of mods. Remember what I said about survival worlds? I tested out all the inventory pets from the inventory pet mod, and I checked out new biomes from the biomes o plenty mod.

Problems started to appear, but I ignored the warning signs. The game would crash way more, and there was this bug where I sometimes couldn't press the buttons on the title screen. When I finally acknowledged that something was wrong, it was when I had downloaded a certain mod that caused there to be an error screen every time I tried to launch Minecraft, and it would crash soon after that.

I shrugged and went to bed. Hoping that my Chromebook had just overheated, and things would be solved the next day. Nope. When I clicked on the Minecraft launcher, a different error came up saying something like Linux apps can't open. I panicked and looked up on Google the specific error, but nothing came up. I waited another day, but the same error screen. Not only could I not launch the Forge launcher, but I couldn't play my vanilla worlds either.

So that meant all my hard work on all of the minecraft worlds I had on my Chromebook was all down the drain. I wish I could have backed up my worlds, but you can't do that on a Chromebook. My world files are in my Linux files, and that won't open either. So it really was too good to be true. You can't play games on Chromebooks, and really shouldn't try. I guess Icarus really did fly too close to the sun.

TL:DR- I downloaded Minecraft mods to my Chromebook that crashed the system and made Minecraft literally unplayable.",8
TIFU By Taking Opiods and Almosy Dying,t2_9ongf67z,"Obligatory this wasn't very recent. More like a year and a half at this point. I'm no longer in this headspace, but I've never really thought about this until now. 

Exactly two years ago today, my dad was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive cancer of the duodenum. It was rapid, within 3 months he went from completely normal, to me giving the go ahead along with my brother for the DNR after he was intubated in the ICU. 

Everything went so fast, I feel like I got whiplash from it all. But anyway, my dad was prescribed very intense opiod painkillers. Stuff that only people in end of life care could get, specifically because he was a cancer patient. He was prescribed a variety of pain killing medication because od how intense his cancer was, and almost none of them worked. He was addicted the opiods, but they only ever offered a moments respite, before he was shouting in pain again.

It was very painful, not knowing what to do.  When he passed away we had more than a pharamcies worth of the stuff. I don't even remember the dosage, but I believe it was around 4 mg of fentanyl for the pills, which had absolutely no effect on him. Eventually he got the patches, but those caused their own set of problems so we discarded them for the less effective, but more accessible pills. At least when he wasn't in admittance at a hospital, which was very rare because of his pain

Every year, for as long as I remember, I get cluster headaches for a certain period of the year, which just so happened to conveniently be around the time he passed away, and the dust was starting to settle. Me, and my bright idea was to take one of these pills, with absolutely no tolerance to opiods, knowing and seeing, first hand, what opiod addiction can do to a person, because I just couldn't stand the headaches that day.  When I took it, I felt fine. But I felt very drowsey soon after, I slept for almost 14 hours after taking it. I didn't even realize I could have died from an overdose.

Pretty soon after, I  looked up the proper procedures to disposing of the fentanyl, and washed my hands completely of the stuff. I really wanted nothing to do with it, but looking back I could have easily died from what I did. 


TLDR: Took my dad's opiods like a dumbass and went to sleep for 14 hours. I could have died but luckily I woke up and got rid of the stuff. I didn't realize until very recently that could not be here right now.",2
TIFU by ordering for 7 at 2 am,t2_pzluk,"This happened a couple days ago. We were coming back from my grandmother’s funeral (not COVID, w/ social distancing and masks and lots of hand sanitizer and hand washing) and it got really late and we were all hungry. For reference, we are a family of 7. I said i’d stop by McDonald’s and order something for all of us. 

I pull up to the open drive thru lane and begin to order. A lot. It’s 6 large meals and a 20pc nuggets with fries and soda on the side because no one else eats a 20pc nuggets as a meal only. At the last order we get told to wait a moment. After about a minute they come back and finish the order.

I pull up to the paying window and pay my food. There is one car in front of me. He gets his drinks and waits. After a couple of minutes, the guy obviously didn’t get the end of his order and speeds away. My cousin who was with me and I start nervous laughing because hahaha it’s 2 am and we just bombarded the kitchen with a big order. 

I pull up for my food and i can see no one anywhere in sight. Up on their screens the big ass ticket i just put in. Oops. Then I glance down at their times and they are now 1 minute behind on their orders. Time passes. Now 3 minutes behind. Two cars have pulled away from the line because of the wait and sped off. The truck behind us has paid and is resigned to waiting with us. 5 minutes behind and we see signs of life inside the poor establishment. The line has grown longer and is not moving. We get our food and then after a bit more our drinks. We leave the wrecked mess that is the minimum wage night shift at McDonalds. Sorry.

TL;DR: pulled up to McDonald’s at 2 am with a 7 person order causing the restaurant to put everyone on the gigantic order I have placed. 3 people left the line, one of those with only half of their order. Sorry.",4
Tifu by being single too long,t2_i5syf9s,"This tifu takes place during the span of two years. 

To start off, I live in a very small town, like below 1k population and there's not a lot of singles women my around my age, so ""adult video sites"" was a frequent visit. 

But as luck would have it, a certain lady from a couple of years ago was up for a fun visit again, we'd tried before now and again but life got in the way every time.

So I get myself to her place for a whole day's visit, no car so it's busses and trains for me.
Without getting too graphic and sounding like a douchebag, we did this, this and that, she comes, we snuggle and take a nap.

Back up and at it, do that, that, and this, she comes. Now what's going through my mind is basically *the fuck can't I cum?* 
As with the aforementioned trains and busses, there's a schedule we gotta keep. She too realizes I haven't cum yet so she sets off the rectify the matter, and again without getting too graphic, she Goes. To. Town on it. 
And I'm sitting there looking at her, she's looking all sexy at me, and I still can't fucking cum and feeling like an absolute a-hole and finally  sort of awkwardly have to take matters into my own hands.  
So during my prolonged extreme singleness I have basically daily death gripped my lil buddy to the point its ""un-be-comming"" and will now have to try to live the monk life to rectify this. 

We both go *this was great, let's do it again sooner* and I start my way home, writing this shit.

TIFU - I got my bag stuck in a metro door for a very long time,t2_x9tle,"I got on the metro in Chengdu, China to take my normal three stop, 15 minute journey to work.  If you've been on a typical early morning Chengdu metro, you'll know they are packed like sardines in a cans - extremely full!. Just as someone was getting off,  they bumped into me and knocked me into the door, while the door was closing. A cord on my bag got trapped in the door and was totally stuck in the door. I tried to remove it but it wasn't budging. Normally, the door would open at the next stop, no problem! There was a problem, though. The next stop, the doors switched, so the door opposite opened and the door that I was attached to would remain closed until the terminal 1.5 hours away. I spent the rest of the journey leaning on the door, hiding my bag, pretending there was no issue. If my bag was empty, I probably would have just got off and left it in the door as a work of art. At the terminal, I notified a conductor who had to call an engineer. The engineer used some tool to pry open the door. 30 mins later, and 2 hours after I set off, I was free. I told my employers and tried to laugh off the problem, but employers are often very direct in Chengdu. They just gave me a soft telling off for being late and deducted it from my salary.

First lockdown happened, (coming up to a year ago soon, wow) and I decided to get fit. Being a fitness noob I had to buy all the sporty do-dahs and whatamacallits and was ready to go. Had my protein shaker with me for the first home session and that double chocolate protein mix tasted sublime. Then during my second session, the next day, something must have distracted me because I didn't finish that session and that in turn was my very last session. And here lies the crux to the FU, that protein shake I had prepared for session 1.5 was never drank.

I forgot about it for the most part but whenever I did see that half full protein shake sitting on my bedroom locker, it was if it was mocking me for giving up on my fitness dreams. And this mocking didn't encourage me to get rid of it either because who doesn't like to wallow in misery and regret sometimes.

But today was the day I had enough and decided to vanquish it to the kitchen sink. What followed next when I pried open the shaker is a stench so retched, I will never forget it. It was like a mix of expired milk, rotten eggs and a faint hint of chocolate, basically it smelled like a sewage problem at the Wonka factory. I can still smell the stink in my nostrils 8 hours later. 

I ended up chucking the shaker in the bin as the plastic had somehow fused and molded into the chocolate sludge. So let this be a lesson to wash your shakers and not to give up on your fitness dreams. 

TL/DR I didn't wash my protein shaker for 9 months and it ruined my nostrils.",7
tifu by not saying good morning to my father,t2_1ihwn9w9," So  I'm stuck at home because of Covid, which is why I (unfortunately) run  into my father almost every morning. Now I'm not a morning person and my  throat often gets really dry overnight so that I need something to  drink. And I'm ill so every time I don't drink for an hour my throat  will feel like a goddamn grater. You can imagine what I feel like in the  morning before having my first cup of tea. The thing is my father  apparently expects me shout good morning every time I see him or some  shit as if I'd be happy to know that guy. So after several days of  mocking me for ""developing backwards"" and ""forgetting how to speak"" he  got really angry at me today for deciding to ignore him while I make my  tea. Even better after I tried to explain that my throat hurts (with a  barely audible, cracking voice cause again I'm fucking sick) he just  went ""Oh NOW she speaks!"" like me and my behaviour just somehow became  even more appalling to him than what already is the case. Needless to  say I stormed out of there and now I'm here angry, frustrated and with a  hurting throat cause I still don't have my tea. Thanks ""father""

TL;DR: I didn't tell my father good morning cause I'm sick and my throat hurts so now he's angry at me because of it",2
TIFU by mistaking ear dry drops for eye drops,t2_33phecr0,"Obligatory this happened last night

ATM we’re at his mom place seeing his siblings and Mom, everyone but his mom are avid weed smokers, however his mom is not a total fan of such activities. 

We wait for his mom to pass out and then all take turns smoking bowls in the back. It’s our turn, load a bowl and step out to smoke. Everything’s going fine, I take a hit he takes a hit, peachy. Once we’re done we go to empty the bowl and my boyfriend blows the bowl of ash right up into his face and into his eye. 

Transition to the bathroom, he’s running water over his eye and trying to get the stuff out of his eye. The waters not really helping so he asks me to find him some eye drops. Now, I’m not very familiar with his moms house or medical supply stash. I’m high, a little freaked out because he’s freaked out, and digging through the drawers of pills like a starving raccoon in a dumpster. 

I finally find what I think are eye drops and bring them over to my poor unsuspecting boyfriend. He glances at them and full sends disaster into his eye. Instantly made a minor situation much worse. We basically dumped isopropyl and salt into his eye, escalating the pain tenfold. 

Now he’s in the kitchen, running water over his eye and doing what we can to sooth his burning eye. I finally find actual eye drops and try to use those to flush his eye even more. 

The situation doesn’t improve and eventually his mom and everyone gets involved. We can’t do much for the pain, but eventually we decide it’s best if he just lays down and goes to sleep.    

Even sleeping is hard but with some sleeping meds and a little distraction he’s out. Feeling better today, still irritated and needs an eye patch as bright light doesn’t help. 

TLDR; Grabbed “eye drops” to help get something out of my boyfriends eye and only made it worse by grabbing ear dry drops instead..",12
TIFU by trying edibles at a concert.,t2_5cpgr27c,"       Buckle your seatbelts, this is a good one. Granted, this was a few years ago, but this is the perfect place to expose myself. 
         Alright, so I found out Slayer was doing their farewell tour, and of course I needed tickets. F*ck up #1, buying pit tickets. My first ever pit experience. Keep in mind, I was 5,4 and 125 pounds. Me and my best friend, who is accompanying me, decide to kick it up a notch. Which brings us to f*ck up #2. Paying my other friend to make us edibles for the concert. At this point in my life, neither me or my best friend had ever taken edibles, and he’d never even smoked.  Day of the concert, we do our thing. Friend only eats part of his, I down the entire brownie. We’re in the pit, Phil Anselmo and his band play. We don’t feel anything yet. We start thinking our friend played us. Next band comes out, I start to feel a lil ~weird.~ Then it hits me like a ton of bricks. (Any metal church fans out there?) y’all. When I say I kept disappearing and nodding back into reality, I mean it. I cried, kept fading in and out of reality. I had no idea weed could do this. By the time slayer comes out, I’m GONE. The intro starts, curtain drops, and that’s all I remember from the actual stage. I’m panicking, needing to get out. Me and my friend swim through the crowd, and I have no idea how long it took us to get out. We sat out most of the concert, as I could barely even think. The ride home was a blur. Matter of fact, the next few days were a blur. 
Upon further investigation, 2 grams of Captain America OG made into 2 brownies comes out to around 240 mg per brownie, if that gives any of you an idea. Ive learned my lesson. 

Tl;dr ate a 240mg brownie at a slayer concert, in the pit. Thought I was going to die.",1
TIFU half of the exams of the class,t2_5imvlvn9,"One week before the holidays, I had a music exam at the fifth hour. 

During the break, I was with four friends and two asked: ""what was melodic and what harmonic?"", and two answered: ""harmonic is when the two notes are played at the same time, and melodic is the opposite"", and (I am really bad at music) I say: ""no, I'm not very sure but I think that melodic is when you play the two notes at the same time, and harmonic the opposite"". 

They believed me and 1 hour later half of the class heard that I said how harmonic and melodic are like and they believed me. 

Fifth hour, the exam, everyone including me is thinking ""oh this is going to be easy, I know everything, even the harmonic and melodic theory"". 
30 minutes after the teacher has give us the exam, someone asks something to the teacher and he throws an indirect that makes me think that all the harmonic and melodic theory I know is exactly the opposite, what my friends answered before me was the correct theory. 

End of the exam, I am talking with one friend about my fuck up and how I realized I was wrong and I corrected it before the end, she has corrected it too, another friend joins the conversation, he realizes that he put it wrong and he didn't correct it, he wants too kill me, half of the class put it wrong, half of the class want to kill me, some people of that half fail the exam. 

TL;DR: I said one answer wrong and half of the class believed me, half of the class has fail the exam.",33
TIFU by telling my girlfriend that her pregnant friend has a nice ass,t2_9oh3vvc4,"My girlfriend has this friend she met in college who is like four or five months pregnant, so now that her belly is more noticeable she's starting to send my girlfriend pictures of her belly.

Today ny girlfriend sent me a photo of her friend showing her belly, I was in work hours so I didn't pay much attention to the photo, so what does my dumbass self thinks? ""oh, my girlfriend sent me a photo sticking out her belly"", how did I get to that conclusion? You may ask, well she previously told me that she was going to exercise, so I thought she was being silly with her belly after december, but boy was I wrong. 

So, after my genius brain came to that conclusion I said to her: ""nice ass"", so she got really mad she just sent me a message just saying ""???????? WTF"" and hasn't speak to me all day. Wish me luck guys.

TL;DR
My girlfriend sent me a photo of a pregnant friend of hers showing her belly, I confuse her with my girlfriend and said to her ""nice ass"". Hasn't talked to me all day.",2
TIFU by asking a blind man for his driver's license,t2_mf469,"By ""today I fucked up"" I mean ""about fifteen years ago I fucked up.""

While a student in university, I had the privilege of working in our campus bookstore. It was a small university, and the bookstore staffed about 15 students, with two or three of us working at any given time. It was a wonderful experience and great way to meet new people (and would highly recommend to anyone in university or college now).

Anyway, one of our semi-regular customers was a ""mature"" student (he was probably in his 30s), who was visually-impaired. He carried a white cane and had a beautiful guide dog, and while he wasn't likely 100% blind (he was still regularly buying print-textbooks), he was clearly visually-impaired.

At the time, students could choose to pay for textbooks with debit/credit card, or by charging the books to their student account (which typically held the balance of their student loan). In order to charge to your student account, you needed either your student ID card, or your student number and a piece of photo ID.

So, when this man approached the register with his items and told me he wanted to charge them to his account, I asked for his student ID.

""Sorry,"" he told me, ""I don't have it with me.""

""No problem."" I replied, ""All I need is your student number and a driver's license.""

Silence.

My co-worker standing at the register beside me slowly turned her head to stare at me in disbelief of what she just heard.

""Um..."" the man said with a smirk, ""they don't really let me drive."" 

I can't remember exactly what happened after that because the embarrassment basically shut my brain off, but I think I said something like ""ugghghhhgghhhhhhhhh okay no problem"" and charged it without his ID and hid in the back of the store for the rest of the day. He was a very chill dude and clearly found my blunder funny, but it was too much for me to handle.

TL;DR Asked an obviously visually-impaired man for a ""driver's license"" rather than ""photo ID,"" embarrassed myself and maybe the man and probably his guide dog.",18
TIFU by taking photos of myself in my new clothes,t2_2uvdc3wc,"TIFU by taking photos of myself in my new clothes

This happened a few minutes ago. Today my clothing sale haul arrived and I excitedly opened my parcels and tried on all my clothes. My mum had sent me a bit of money to help replenish my wardrobe in the sales (being a poor student I was super grateful and excited for the opportunity to buy clothes that weren't from Primark) so I thought I'd send her some photos of me trying them on seeing as I'm away at uni. I was having a great time enjoying my new clothes and taking funny photos. I particularly liked the new black shorts with fabric suspenders and I took a funny, mock sexy photo where I hold the suspenders and stare into the camera in a sultry way (with my tongue stuck out so it's a bit less serious).

Anyway I finish trying on my clothes and taking photos and I pick out the best to send to my mum. I also decided to send them to my grandma as I like to keep in contact with her. Once I've finished this I scroll through the photos I sent to my grandma to double check I didn't send the ones with my eyes closed. But then my eyes lock on to something in the background. Last night my boyfriend and I had gotten up to some fun in the bedroom and of course this was the one time we didn't bother to put the lube away. And yes. In the background of every photo I had sent. It was there (including in the mock sexy one). I died inside a little. I told my boyfriend and he said I could try and unsend them quickly but it was too late. They'd been sent and seen already by both my mum and my grandma. My boyfriend tried to reassure me. The bottle looks a lot like a hand soap bottle so he thought it might look like hand sanitiser. Yeah ok maybe it isn't that bad, I thought. But then he zoomed in a little to enhance the silhouette of two people going at it on the bottle. And next to the roll of toilet paper this really didn't look so good. I then realised that the empty chocolate wrappers strewn about next to them looked horribly like condom wrappers. At this point I want to jump out the window of our fourth floor flat. My boyfriend is laughing his arse off but telling me they probably won't notice and I'm curled up in bed now writing this in an attempt to find some humour in the situation so I don't want to cry.

TL;DR tried on my new clothes and sent photos to my mum and grandma only to realise there was a bottle of lube and toilet roll in the background along with some chocolate wrappers that looked like condom wrappers",18
Tifu by sleeping naked,t2_2wf4sn0y,"Tifu by sleeping naked

So early yesterday night I was uncomfortable and kept thinking why and I uncomfortable? So I took off my clothes. I felt comfortable and rolled my self up in my blankets like a mummy and drifted off to sleep.

Then I had a dream I was in sum type of anime with weapons for handling and catching monsters. But the monster we were up against was a golden mewtow, but not just any mewtwo. One that is a mix between Alakazam and mewtwo both being the strongest and smartest monster he decided to turn invisible and in my dream I hit him hen I felt it he was trying to crush my nuts. 

I felt it and I was waking up?

Why am I waking up this is a new experience but not a bad one since it’s a dream?

Then as my dream crossed into blurry eye vision I saw I was snapping my fingers as my hands were reaching for my huevos 

Not just snapping with sound but the kind when you but your index fingers together an 🤞  spread your thumb out 👍 so it kind of looks like this 👆 and imagine it closing in on itself fast enough to make your dry ass hand make a friction noise and you got to on them coming for you precious eggs in between you legs hanging for a human bag. 

And I started freaking out but couldn’t to anything since I was paralyzed and it was like being on a train waiting for you to fall off a cliff. Then right when my eyes got in blurred I was able to stop my hand from squeezing my nuts into peanut butters. 

And now I learned my lesson to sleep with at least underwear on.

TIFU by not exiting Bulbapedia on my phone.,t2_34yrv3zr,"This FU technically occurred yesterday, but the consequences are occurring today.

Me and my friends are all competing in a Pokemon Sun and Moon ""race,"" and since my memory on things like game mechanics and type advantages has gotten rusty, I've been using Bulbapedia (a very useful Pokemon wiki) to check that kind of stuff and gain the upper hand.  Typically, I use the site on my computer instead of my easier-to-access cell phone.  This is because of screen time limits: because I use my phone too much, I helped my parents set up a screen time limit that disables non-essential phone apps and websites after two hours of use.

Now we begin the mess-up: yesterday, my computer was inaccessible and I needed to see on what route I could get myself a riolu, so I went on my phone to look it up on Bulbapedia.  I had only two minutes of screen time left, so I wasn't able to get the information before my phone timed out.  *No matter,* I thought.  *I can just look it up on a different device.*  So I put my phone in the kitchen in sleep mode, and went on with my day.

Unbeknownst to me, the website was still running on my phone - I didn't close the site.  That's my mistake right there, was that I left it open.  I don't know how it remained active in sleep mode, but Bulbapedia was still on.  And it was on the rest of the day.  And it was on the whole night.  And it was still running for just shy of a full 24 hours.  Even though my phone was in sleep mode, even though my phone had another restriction (downtime) activate from last night to 9 AM today, Bulbagarden managed to run despite the odds.  My phone easily ran out of screen time before I even touched it today, and now I can't use it to talk with friends on Discord or to do anything fun and distracting today, simply because of a website on Safari pulling a fast one on me.

Now, you may be wondering, ""Infernoking23, this sure does suck, but there's no real consequence in this story.  What makes your baby-hands tale worthy of sharing the same digital space as legendary nursery rhymes like [the Major Tom technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c7kqjl/tifu_by_performing_the_major_tom_technique_and/) and [El Coconut Fleshlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rr6ay/tifu_by_cumming_into_a_coconut/)?""  See, that's because I was going to use my phone while my foot got meddled with.  Let me elaborate: I have three planters warts on my right foot, with two of them being on my toes.  I have to go to the doctor's office today because they are contagious, and I'm getting injections to wipe them from existence.  The problem with that is, I'm scared as shit about the appointment, so I wanted to use my phone and watch some YouTube videos to keep my mind off the hour-long treatment.

But now that my phone is no longer usable, that means I have nothing to keep my thoughts off the dreadful appointment.  My FU of not closing Bulbapedia means the next hour of my life is going to be fucking terrifying.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Didn't close a website on Safari while screen time was disabling it, which somehow ran for almost 24 hours and drained today's screen time.  This means I can't use it to entertain and distract from an hour-long foot doctor appointment where I get toe injections.  God fucking dammit.",8
TIFU by relying on my peripheral vision,t2_1fmsviig,"Long time lurker, my first post. 
Sorry if there's formatting issues - mobile 
TL;DR at the bottom.

Context: I work at the flagship store for the biggest vape retailer in my country, I try work hard and be that sales clerk that treats customers like people, not wallets. Now, this store is big, and by big, I mean 10m long counter, flat screen, leather couches, pool, air hockey, and a fooseball table...

So... Today I had a guy come in with some short girl, I wasn't really focusing just tryna help him out as he had called in earlier asking about a specific flavored vape juice that was out of stock so I was trying to find him a similar alternative.

I grabbed some e-juice and came back to the counter as he said ""sorry sweetie, I know you hate it when I spend money on this stuff"" but, seemingly unbothered, she remained quiet and walked around checking out the fooseball and air hockey tables like most of the kids do. He says he's gonna step outside to test my proposed alternative (Can't vape in the store due to COVID regulations) and try the juice to see if he wants a second bottle. 

I'm busy ringing up the guys purchase and notice in the corner of my eye the little girl proceeding to sit in one of the chairs opposite the counter.
Now we've got a bag of lollipops for any kids that come into the store... It was sort of a Christmas thing, but seeing as we seldom see kids, we have plenty left.

Before he bounces outside, as I normally would, (because kids are often off in their own worlds) I say, confidently smiling to the dad, 
""I've got something that might make your daughter a little happier while she waits"" 
He chuckled...
""That's not my daughter"" 
Oh, whoops, he must feel really old now *internal face palm* that must be his little sister.
""That's my wife"" 
.......It wasn't, as I thought I'd seen out the corner of my eye, a kid... But a short and now slightly upset looking Asian lady.

I died internally, but the real punishment was yet to come:
I was then forced to make small talk with her while she waited for her husband to try the juice, making me shudder internally with embarrassment more and more with every passing second.
Then I was mocked by my best friend, and colleague for the remainder of the day.



TL;DR: Offered a customer's daughter a lollipop, nope... That's his small Asian wife. Shit.",19
TIFU petsitting,t2_3tg19p9t,"So this happened a few days ago but I thought it would fit this subreddit. For the past few weeks I’ve been petsitting for my neighbors while they’ve been out and while there are minor mishaps, everything was going smoothly until a few days ago. My neighbors have a chicken coop in their backyard with a fenced in pen connected to it so that they can be let outside and there’s also a little door that slides over the exit so that they can be locked in. 

So, the routine is to let them out of the coop in the morning and feed them and fill up their water. I let them out and decided to hang out for a few minutes on my phone on one of their outdoor seating areas and then suddenly the chickens started frantically screeching at the top of their lungs. I fucking BOOKED it to the pen and saw a hawk fly out just as I got there. I thought, “okay, crisis averted” but texted my neighbors to let them know just in case and they said to keep an eye on them so I hung out for a little longer and I heard the screeching again. This time I had to scream and clap at ANOTHER hawk and it eventually flew off but perched 

on a tree nearby. 
I told my neighbors it happened again and they said I should try to get the chickens in the coop and lock them in, so I opened the door and tried to entice them to go in by shaking their food and eventually all but three went inside. There’s about 16 so most of them had gone in. However, the three remaining in the outdoor pen were a problem. I tried chasing them around the pen and jumping and catching them but chickens are fucking FAST and it proved impossible. I again texted my neighbors asking what to do and they said that I could try and use some orange ribbon (the kind used to mark property lines) they had in their garage to tie up some of the bushes in the pen so I could get to them easier. 

So I followed their advice and the ribbon was pretty tangled around these three wooden stakes so I spend around 10 minutes just sitting on their living room floor just trying to untangle it. When I finally got it decently untangled, I went out to the coop with it and I saw a hawk and clapped at it hard until I saw it fly off. But by then it was too late and I saw a chicken laying limp on the ground and my stomach dropped. 

It was pretty clear it was dead or dying so I started freaking out but I knew I had to get the last two chickens in so I spent a long time trying to entice the two other chickens in while keeping the 13 other chickens in the coop at the same time and one of the last two eventually walked in and after countless attempts I eventually lunged and caught the other chicken and chucked her in the coop. Then I had to face what happened. My eyes started to water and I called my neighbors to tell them what had happened. Thankfully, they were pretty understanding and didn’t blame me and said I had to *bury* it. I walked over to the chicken and checked to see if it was possibly still alive but it wasn’t very warm and it looked like the hawk had snapped it’s neck so it was definitely dead. 

I picked it up and it’s head flopped around and I started uncontrollably sobbing. I just sat there petting the chicken and sobbing over it and saying that I was sorry for at least fifteen minutes. Then I had to find a shovel to bury it with. So I found a shovel and found a nice spot under a tree by the fence and dug a small grave for the chicken. I also put some leaves on the dirt so that it was more comfortable for the chicken (it just made me feel better). Then I went down to the creek nearby and found some pretty medium-sized white rocks and stacked them on top of each other on top of the grave and I tried to find some flowers but because it’s winter   there weren’t any nearby so I found a small branch with berries and laid it on the rocks. I cried for at least a solid hour that day and I had to go back and petsit and had to see the grave every day when going to the chicken coop.  So... yeah now I have trauma from petsitting. 

TLDR: I petsit chickens and when I was inside for a little, a hawk killed one of them and I had to bury it and make a grave for it in their backyard •_•",10
TIFU by drinking 25 hours worth of 5 hour energy.,t2_8q6igjql,"I literally could not stay still while typing this so excuse some spelling mistakes if any.

So today I went over to a mall with my friends so we could do some random bullshit later with stuff we bought. We went in one of my friends van so we could all fit comfortably. (Not the most fit group)

So we all got in and about ten minutes into the ride one of us decided to back flip into the trunk. (No dash in-between so back seats can be folded) He hit his head on something, we ask what it is and he decides to throw it up to us. It hit the car roof and landed straight on my head.

Well as it turns out my friend who owns the van is a hoarder and has this big pack of many bottles of 5 hour energy.

After a little while we got bored and were thinking of ways to make this more fun for us. (We all live in a rual area far away from any mall.) And long story short I ended up drinking quite a bit of the 5 hour energy stuff. 25 hours worth. This is when I decided anymore could be seriously harmful since I wasn't getting any effects.

We eventually got to the mall and I didn't get any rush effects. After checking out a store or two we head to the food court and got some Chick-fil-A since we wanted some of those spicy chicken sandwiches. And this is when I found out why the 5 hour energy didn't work.

As it turns out, you need food in your stomach for the shit to work. I took about two bites before I asended to levels of energy so extremely high. I nearly had a panic attack if it wasn't for my need to move. I ran around the store so much we all got kicked out. 

We were all in so much amazement that we forgot where the car was, and so I didn't hesitate to run around the entire parking lot once or twice before I found it. I couldn't ride in the car for a while because of how energetic I was and instead ran. The car wasn't going the fast and there was a lot of places they had to stop so I easily caught up.

By the point I go back in the car we were out of town. I had wanted to get back in a while ago, but I could not sit down. I could only get in because I sprained my ankle. And this whole time I felt like I've been overclocked to such an extreme I couldn't think because I kept interrupting myself.

There's some people that walk down my road in the morning and afternoon to keep people from speeding while are in cars more. They almost called an ambulance thinking my immediate health was a time bomb and I was gonna run out. 


TL;DR - Found out how to get 5 hour energy to work and couldn't function for some hours. Almost got put in ER.",4
TIFU by thinking Nexflix and Chill was actually watching movies and relaxing,t2_6mjflk8b,"Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but I didn’t realize until now that I fucked up.

So I don’t know why, but it never occurred to me that saying that you were going to watch Netflix and chill had any other connotations other than I don’t know watching a movie and cuddling under blankets? Over the past how many years, I’ve told my friends that I was just going to watch Nexflix and chill if I was hanging out with a friend with no plans and they’ve been under the impression that I’m casually having sex with several different people at a time where I was just watching a movie and eating popcorn with a friend. I mean I’m very close to being asexual which is most likely why I didn’t notice until now but also why I’m finding this idea even grosser

TIFU by forcing my eyes when taking an eye test,t2_1a422c1u,"This happened a year and a half ago but realization only happened last week

18 months ago I got the amazing news that I had got the job I applied for, at the time, I had just finished college and was only working at a Burger Shop in a shopping centre

Coincidentally, I (32M) had just started my relationship with my partner (32F)

I decided that it was long due I had my eyes tested as I had been living here for 3 years and hadn't had  that done for at least 4 years

&amp;#x200B;

That is where the fuck up starts

Just some context, I have been wearing glasses since I was 7, my prescription is pretty high, I have 5.50+ on each eye also, -2.30 astigmatism on both eyes

Those who wear glasses, know how the test goes, they place a super funny machine in front of your eyes and ask you to read/tell if you can see letters in a small frame at some distance, normally 2 to 3 metres

Without realizing, I forced my eyes during the examination, at the end of it, my dumbass got really happy that my prescription had changed and I had gone from 5.50+ to 4.25 on both eyes, at last, finally some good news, maybe my prescription is decreasing as I age, even dreamt of not wearing my glasses at some point in my life

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few months, the happy time at work is finished, it is time to get hands on as I start to get workload I start to few dizzy and my sleep pattern is completely fucked up, I can barely see the screen as after 30 seconds of focusing my sight, it all goes blurry, I get stressed like 200% as I am not being able to read on my Kindle or read the countless pages of documentation and lines of code and perform decently at my job

This has been going on for months, my relationship took a huge turn, we were fighting nearly daily, I am super stressed with everything, my libido is completely gone, depression tackles me really bad on top of all that is going on in the world right now

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, it was about time to get new glasses, now I have a job that pays me decently and it is not a big deal

&amp;#x200B;

Eye test is taking longer than usual, during the consultation, the optometrist keeps asking me to relax my eyes and so I do it, after 30 minutes she is kind of surprised and asks me - Have you taken a new job where you use your eyes a lot or have you been feeling any difference in your sight and off I go explaining everything to her and she says, all your symptoms kind of connect to the lack you had in your prescription, all the exams came back Ok and I see no sign of any illnesses, I have been using the new ones for the past two weeks

My sleep has improved

My libido is getting back to normal

I can deliver at work

My relationship has improved

Moral of story, don't force your f\*cking eyes when taking an eye test

TIFU by giving myself a chemical burn in my throat.,t2_8wm57p24,"Today I (55m) completely nuked my throat. I'm a fairly adventurous guy, I like hot foods and I don't shy away from eating them. A co-worker makes his own ""nut rub"" as he calls it which is ground peppers. Reapers, habaneros and ghost peppers. He uses this to add heat to all sorts of things. The star of my FU was jerky with reaper and ghost pepper dust liberally applied. It was hot. Nose running, eyes watering hot. That was okay, about 15 minutes later I was able to cope with things. The actual F to the U was later, about 3 hours after eating the jerky. I have a toothache. I use this liquid toothache medicine which is clove oil that you apply to a cotton ball (mini cotton ball) and then pack the cavity. I got my cotton ball loaded, put it into the affected molar and as soon as the oil mixed with my saliva and slid down my throat I was hit with a blinding pain. I couldn't breathe. My throat seized and refused to swallow. My tongue felt like it grew to 4 times its size and I began to salivate copiously. My nose started running, my eyes started watering and my throat was fucking aflame. This lasted about 4 lifetimes. Every second was agony. I was choking, gagging and coughing because the onrush of saliva was trying to go down my windpipe. The whole ordeal lasted a solid 5 minutes before I was finally able to work my tongue loose, swallow the torrent of spit going down my throat and stagger over to my lunch pail  and get a slug of water. It didn't help much. I finally gave up and left work early so I could get some oral anesthetic spray and went home. I'm currently sitting at my computer and contemplating my life choices while occasionally shooting the spray down my throat. Learn from my example and don't mix insanely hot foods with clove oil. Nothing good will come of it.

TL;DR Ate super hot beef jerky and later used clove oil toothache medicine, gave the back of my throat a pretty painful chemical burn.",8
TIFU by not leaving my puppy outside long enough,t2_n288p,"This actually happened today, about two hours ago. We surprised our 7 year old with a puppy for Christmas. He has been asking for one for the past  4 years and my wife and I decided we were ready. My kid has been a superstar about taking the puppy outside and cleaning up after him when necessary. The puppy is pretty good about letting us know when he needs to go outside to potty. He has had a few pee accidents but hasn't dropped any dueces in the house so far. Today is the first day that my kid went back to school and my wife and I both had to work. We used baby gates to isolate the puppy to the kitchen. My wife came home at lunch to take the puppy outside and I got home a few hours after that. I beat my kid's bus by about 15 minutes and rushed to check on the puppy. Sweet, no accidents. I scoop him up and take him out to the backyard. The puppy quickly takes a leak and starts attacking a nearby leaf. I let him play for a couple more minutes and take him back inside. This is where the FU begins, I noticed the house was a little messy and we just got a brand new robot vacuum for Christmas. I grab the remote for the vacuum, get it started and hop in the shower. I take a quick one since my kid will be home in a few minutes. All finished, I towel off, get dressed and walk out of my room just as my kid comes in the front door. ""How was you day kiddo"" I ask. He replied with ""it was ok, why does it smell like poop in here?"" Instantly I catch a wiff as well and we both begin to look for source. I see a brown streak across the living room carpet and my son finds a similar streak in the dining room next to 1/2 of a fresh  pile of shit. Weird, I thought, did the puppy step in it? Nope our new vacuum went straight through the hot steaming pile and proceeded to cover our entire 1st floor with muddy melted peanut buttery puppy poop. My kid picks up the vacuum and gets shit it all over his hands. The puppy has walked though it several times now. My wife comes home as we are struggling to clean up and once she realizes what happened, she busts out laughing. I send my kid to take a bath and my wife starts cleaning the floors while I clean the vacuum. OMG it was every where. The wheels, the spinny thingies, the filter, it took me two hours to clean the damn thing and almost as long for my wife to clean the floors. Once we were finished I looked down to see my new puppy taking a leak on the kitchen floor.

TL;DR My new puppy took a dump on the dining room carpet and my robot vacuum spread it all over my house.",2
TIFU by using too much Bengay,t2_j6vq2,"So this happened about 30 minutes ago. 
*Note for context: 
Me:28
Husband:31*

I have a bad back and threw it out earlier today by just walking around my house. I called my dr but due to covid I couldn’t get an appointment and all the urgent cares in the area were full. Normally I get a few muscle relaxers and move on but since I couldn’t see anyone in person I decided to deal with the issue the “old fashioned way”. 

My husband went and got Advil and Bengay. My dr recommended it along with epsom salt baths. 

I laid down and he put the Bengay on my back and then helped me to the couch. The “hot” feeling it gives actually helped and made my back feel better. 
This lasted about 3.5 hours. 

A few more hours later and it was time for bed and another round of Bengay. My husband was tired and didn’t put on the same amount that he did earlier. I asked him to put more on as we joked around. 

He put on so much Bengay that I’m pretty sure the neighbors think a bus full of old people must have parked in our neighborhood. He rubbed it in and we joked about the smell. 

Here’s where the problem occurs. My back starts to burn. Not in the good way from earlier but from a skin on a hot stove kind of way. To make matters worse my husband thought it would funny to “accidentally” put some cream in the top part of my bottom. 

After some screaming, crying, and a lot of laughter we were able to get enough layers of the cream scraped off to make things more manageable. 

I got into bed and still feel a little extra hotness but it’s nothing I can’t handle but then this weird sensation kicked in and I realized my top bottom is tingly and on fire. 

My husband is laughing so hard the bed is shaking as I’m complaining that my butts gonna burn for the next 3 hours or so. 

We both find the whole thing funny and now know not to use too much Bengay when we’re older. 

TL;DR: 
Bengay burns. Don’t slather it on like it will save your soul and do not put it near your butt.",1
TIFU by drinking,t2_986fswsd,"A story for you

This happened last august but I have been too embarrassed to tell the tale... until now.

It was lockdown and I hadn't drunk in a while, my roommates and I bought a 26er of hennesy for a fun night of dominos w drinking rules. Everything was cool until I started losing each round and got VERY drunk. I didn't even realize how drunk I was until we left the game table and started freestyle rapping.. and recording it no less. the last thing I remember was eating some narsty McDonalds and trying to rap with my mouth full, then came darkness.

next thing I know, I woke up butt ass naked with nothing on but a durag. Oh boy was I in for a treat. My roommates wanted to spare me the details but I needed to know.

A few days after the events my closest roomie divulged the info; I guess I went to bed after the McDonalds but got back up a couple hours later and found my roomies in the living room. I stripped down to my birthday suit in front of them and sat on the couch. I was being the drunk naughty version of myself, I tried to broke someone's bong as a joke and went into someone elses room to scare them... ALL WHILE NAKED. they were trying to wrangle me and I was running around like a greased up hog. The mischievous behavior ended when the caught me and tried to give me my clothes... that's when I vomited all over myself, my clothing and them, then pissed right there in front of them in our hallway. they cleaned everything up and put me to bed. I guess I was still coherent enough to put on my durag though.

I was so embarrassed I think this sent my spiraling for a while and now Im sober so maybe this was all a good thing. hope y'all liked my story - I decided 2021 is my year of honesty and to come out of the shadows of being a reddit lurker.

TL;DR - I got so drunk that I freestyle rapped, got completely naked then threw up and piss everywhere.",12
TIFU by not being thorough enough,t2_103vhn,"I guess this starts a while back, but the fuck-up happened today.  I bought a second hand xbox 360 for the purposes of playing Guitar Hero on back in 2015.  Didn't know at the time, but I bought a system that has some issues with guitar hero (the only game I really have ever played on it).

[There was a thread a while back in r/guitarhero that I'd seen detailing the issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarHero/comments/imkmxb/psa_if_you_play_on_xbox_make_sure_you_have_the/) and I'd heard it mentioned once or twice on the scorehero forums.  Basically, in August 2011, microsoft decided to change the sound card in their Xbox 360 slims, which the guitar hero games developed by Activision and Neversoft didn't like (the harmonix guitar hero game and even rock bands work fine).  What happens is the audio starts to desync from the game, making it harder to keep your timing right, and makes the notes seem ""random"".

Anyway, today I decided I was going to finally buy one that would work with guitar hero (as it's still the only game I play really.  That and rock band).  So I called my nearby stores asking if they had any 360s in.  Only one store did, and they had 2 original 360s (which are guaranteed to work, and both had HDMI output, which is a plus), a slim (which the power adapter was rated for the same model I had already that has the issue), and an E (which I had thought was just a model of the slim before heading off to the store).  The guy working there said I could come by and test the consoles out and see if they'd work.  I had my preferences that I'd rather not get an older one that's just going to crap out on me (I don't want to deal with a RROD), so I tried out the E first.

Additionally, I brought my own copy of Guitar Hero 5 to test (as it has issues on my slim, has all the songs unlocked from the start, and has relatively long songs).  This was the only game I brought in to test as i figured its the same issue on all the games.  This was what led to my fuck-up.

Game played fine, I chose 21st Century Schizoid Man because it's one of the longer songs on the game, which would let me amplify the issue if it's there.  It's also a song that has stuff at the end of the song that would be an indicator if it's having the issue.

Song works fine no issues.  So being that a newer model is my preference, I stop testing right there and buy the console.  It was also priced near the price of the original, although slightly more ($109 vs $100).  I did however get a lower price because I didn't want a controller included.

I got home and spent most of my day transferring my data over to the new 360 (I was using a thumb drive.  This was really annoying).

Finally (about an hour ago maybe?), I booted up Guitar Hero Metalica to play Master of Puppets.  The issue happened :/

Booted up Guitar Hero 5 to see if it was also having issues, played the same song I played in the store and it worked fine still.

Looks like if I brought more games (or at least guitar hero metallica), I could have bought a system that would work for me.  Instead I'm stuck with two xbox 360s that don't do what I want, and even less money than I had before :/

TL;DR tried to buy an xbox that works well with guitar hero games.  Was allowed to test the consoles, but picked a game to test that apparently works on one of the models that doesn't work well with the other guitar hero games.",2
"TIFU by being surprised someone was female, and then responding to a joke and offending someone else unintentionally",t2_6f9uleil,"So I was in a private discord server with a few people, and we were about to invite another person from reddit. The person that sent the invite referred to the person as her. Now, I didn't know that the person was a her, so I typed ""Her?"" And the entire discord chat suddenly went silent. I asked why they went silent, and then they asked me to check the person's reddit profile. I checked.... and they had a transgender flag pfp, and the pfp said ""I'm trans so that's cool."" I realize I fucked up and some other guy jokingly said that he can't tell my mother from a cow so it was alright.

Now, at this point, the mood was much lighter, but then I decide to fuck up again. I say to the chat ""My mom died a few months ago"". She didn't, but it was meant to be a dark joke. Then some other guy said same, and I assumed he was joking.

He then asked me ""What month?"" and I made up a fake month, and then he replied with an actual disease and date. That's when I realize: I fucked up badly.

For a few minutes the discord chat says that they are sorry for his and my loss. I say after it was actually a joke, and thankfully, things have cleared up.

TLDR: Asked if someone was a her when they were transgender, make a dark joke about how my mom was dead and learn that someone's mom actually died a few months ago.",1
TIFU by suggesting going to a park,t2_4u7w1roa,"TL;DR: We went to a park by my suggestion, end up being scared by some weird folk trying to possibly fake a domestic abuse dispute. 

My little family of four went out with my aunt and our little cousin to eat. While my mom was filling up the car with gas, I realized we were very close to a park with a view point of the city (won’t say where out of privacy), so we set the GPS and went there. It’s a very pretty place, except the trash that flew out due to the very.. minimal care. We were taking some pictures and were having a good time. My younger sister said she needed to use the restroom, but she didn’t want to go alone and wanted to make sure the doors weren’t locked, so i went with her. We notice a guy, Honduran most likely, following behind us. I, being a guy, tried to put on a strong face to let him know that i’d hurt him if he tried to get to my sister. He ended up walking around the building and we really didn’t see him afterwards. 

My sister and i ended up walking back since the doors were locked, and saw my mom and aunt talking to a small lady, probably also either Honduran or Guatemalan. We got close to them and even with the accent, i was able to pick up on it (i only really speak english and mexican spanish) and found out she was telling my mom and aunt that the guy that had followed us was hitting her and threatened to kill her. 

As someone who was in a situation similar to that, I got really angry and stayed alert the whole time. At one point my mom tells the lady to go check on her child that was left in the car, and the lady responds “No, you go check on him, i’m scared. Please help me.” My mom, as she already had told her before, said “I really can’t help you with anything other than calling the police.” 

The woman snapped back “Well, are you going to f***ing help me or not?” A car came driving by and a man stepped out, talked to the woman, and took her child and her things and put them in the car. He looked at us and winced before hopping back in the car and yelled something at her. “Look, If you’re not going to help me, i’m going to leave” was the last thing she told us before running in the car and left.

The man from before came out and yelled at us “Where the hell did she run to now?” 
We ignored him and ran back to our car as yet another dude comes up and starts talking to him. In fear of a gun fight or something, we sped off. I think the only thing that scared me more was the woman. She didn’t give clear answers and she wasn’t crying with tears. she looked drunk/drugged. None of us could tell if it was all staged so they could hurt us or something of the sort since we were all mostly women (and i still kind of look like one). I just don’t want to think about what happened.",2
TIFU by smoking WAY too much weed,t2_51os8m9m,"Okay so this actually didn't happen today it happened last night.

It all started when I met my ex girlfriend to go and visit my daughter (she was on a camping trip with my exes parents) and after having a pretty good time driving and talking to her she suggests I spend the night at her place to make it easier in the morning when her parents get back with the kid. We're just hanging out in the living room when she asks me if I want to smoke a little weed. I agree. Now my weed smoking history is little to none. I have smoked a couple times before but it must've not been enough because I didn't even feel high or even a buzz. This time however I really did want to have a nice time chilling with my ex (wanting to get back with her but its complicated) so I take about 4 big hits and prepare to chill the fuck out. This was a huge mistake. 

As soon as I start feeling it my heart starts racing so fast I thought it might burst out of my chest. Everything was going in slow motion and if I didn't move I froze in place not being able to move. I might have fainted but I can't remember. It is so hard to describe what I was feeling but it was NOT good. I tried telling my ex this but it was so hard to talk and I couldn't quite make the words come out right. She was starting to get really freaked out and this caused me to start having a panic attack. This would be the first of many panic attacks and paranoia. All the while my ex was freaking out and wouldn't come near me and getting ready to leave. I couldn't understand what was going on so I was truly scared and thought I was going to die. I felt like I had to manually breathe and if I stopped I wouldn't be able to breathe anymore. 

I was finally able to lie down on the couch and try to sleep it off. She decides to order food and asks me if I could pay which I agree. But then I start thinking that she is using me for my money (paranoia) and start having another panic attack. The food arrives and I try to eat but I just can't eat anything at all. After all of that I lay down and finally have some much needed rest. But this is also when the terrible nightmares started and I couldn't sleep much. Today when I woke up I tried apologizing but she kinda doesn't acknowledge me and leaves for work. I'm worried this will kinda ruin the relationship we have now and I am also very embarrassed that this happened the way it did.

TL;DR: I smoked too much with my ex, had panic attacks and paranoia, and now I'm worried it will ruin the already messed up relationship we have.",5
TIFU by letting me act before I think.,t2_52gqrqyf,"So the story is this, today school has started again, and it goes semi normal. Though one thing is I needed some new headphones for my laptop so I can focus in class, as my dog had bit on my previous ones. So me and my mom planned to go to target to get some after school. Though, unexpectedly to me at least, a good friend of hers had visited us and brought his son. I wanted to hang out with him, so I thought we would play COD Warzone. Thing is, I didn’t have Gold/Live. 

Also for context or anything, I am 18 years old, I live with my mom, and do not work, I have a debit card, in which I get money either through child support or something similar, though today I only had like....$4 in my account, yes seriously. Just know I’m a avid collector of transformers and have a lack of self control when it comes to them and the opportunities to buy them. This is important for later on. 

Anyways, back to the story, so instead of being honest and say...play a single player game. I go ahead and buy the 1 month membership for Gold, which is $10 I believe. Which puts me in the negatives/a overdraft fee already to around $-8. We play, the friend and his son soon leave and I tell my mom on the purchase and she says we have to go to the bank to deposit money for that overdraft fee. 

We do so, but we first go to target to get the small groceries my mom bought there via take out. She said I should take this opportunity to go inside and find some headphones. She gives me $40, and I had $40 in my wallet already, just note that this money was given to me by my Aunt to save for a gaming PC, she gave $100. It goes normally, most of the headphones seemed to have sold out cause it was late, but I find some for around...$15 I believe. But then...the plastic addiction took over(I consider me collecting transformers a plastic addiction). I go to the toy isle where the Transformers are and see some toys I was really interested in and wanted. I was thinking at first, but my impulsive took over and I got 3 figures. Each $19.99 each. In which I go to the self checkout, the cost was around $81.38. To lower it, I used the little money I had, $1.40, in the target mobile app. I do it, now the price was $79.90. I continue the checkout, getting ¢10 in change. I go back to the car and basically keep on thinking on my horrible decision. My mom gets upset initially, but she’s had a long day, so she stopped. We then went to a atm to get money out of her own account(we use different banks) and transferred it to my account. Which I still feel horrible for, as she is using her own money to correct my mistake. So yeah....thanks for reading and hope you all have a good week, and year even. 


TL;DR : Got myself into a overdraft fee with me knowing fully, went to target and had money that was to be used for only some headphones, use it to buy Transformers figures, mom had to take money from her account to transfer it to mine to fix the overdraft fee

TIFU by trying to go to sleep,t2_9o8yk43s,"So this just happened and i feel like i just got punched in the stomach, so let me explain, sometimes when I have problems sleeping I rub a quick one out because it really helps getting things out of my mind. So i go on ph like every other man and do my thing. And right before preparing to clean my mess, my fucking *sister* comes barging in my room. **Oh**. **My**. **Fucking.** **God**. I felt my heart drop to my stomach and start yelling to her to get the fuck out of my room but she looked at me for a literal fraction of a second and *realised* what i was doing and then she asked me where are her shoes, while i was with my wee wee in my hand trying to cover myself up, then she looks for the shoes (also i forgot to mention this all happened with the lights off so it was pretty dark except the lights from my window giving a bit of lights but just a bit), then holy fucking shit it gets even worse she only finds one of her shoes and i had to point with *the hand that i had done the deed with* to the other shoe, she picks up her shoe and then prepares to leave then my dad comes out the living room asking why am i shouting and then my sister tells him that i dont know what the hell am i doing and then she goes downstairs, i clean up my mess and then wonder what the hell am i going to do now and what could she say to my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

 TL;DR I tried to challange myself and stealthly steal my sisters shoes without her noticing, then i paid the price by her walking in on me rubbing one out whilst searching for her missing shoes.

Ok, so now that i have calmed down a bit i want to add some missing details i skipped in my panic.

My sisters room is right next to mine, in my lockdown boredom i decided to go in her room to rile her up a bit just for fun, you know banter between brothers type off stuff and i decided that i should try stealing her shoes ( they were some unicorn house shoes recieved as a new year present from one of her friends) and surprise surprise i sucedeed, i then went back in my room and continued playing some overwatch, then she notices her shoes are gone and that tracks back to what i wrote above, she comes barging in my room when i was doing the deed.

Im too tired to write more, so ill go to sleep and update tommorow and give more details if u want to, sorry for any grammar mistakes i have made, english is not my first language.",10
"TIFU by misspelling the name of my to-be interviewer in my cover letter, and it is likely to be addressed in the ""Are you detail orientated?"" segment of said interview later today.",t2_twz4q,"TL;DR I managed to misspell the name of my boss's sort-of boss in a cover letter when re-applying to my sort-of current job, and now it's going to be brought up within the interview I have today with half a dozen interviewers.

Just as a heads up, I am deliberately keeping various names/genders/details anonymous. Ya know, just to be safe. So, if my wording sounds a bit strange, that's \[mostly\] to blame. The actual F.U. was performed few weeks ago when I wrote the cover letter, but it all comes to a head today.

As per the title, I have an interview for a job in a few hours for a permanent administrative assistant position. A very detail-orientated job, indeed. I have actually already been doing remotely for some number of months, but just on a loose, per diem basis. They've approved of a regularly scheduled staff member now, and as I had originally fallen into it by way of mutual connection, I now have to formally apply and be hired for the position. The interview will be conducted by a half a dozen people or so, with my direct boss being the only one of whom I have so far met or even actually heard of prior to this formal \[re\]application process (the others are board members of some kind; in my mind it's an excessively large interview panel, given the actual job). Anyway, I was talking to said boss yesterday, asking if there was anything specific that I ought to do to prepare for the interview. Amongst all that was said, I was informed that I will be asked if I am ""attentive to detail"", and that I managed to misspell Shmidt, the names of one of those other interviewers, on the cover letter. I had written Schmidt. Which, I mean, damn it. Shmidt was the one whom I addressed the cover letter to, and appears to be who has the single largest influence on the hiring process. I was told Shmidt would be the one to likely ask me if I'm detail orientated, and just by the way it was worded, it is related to the misspelling.

On the one hand I should have caught it. It was an easy thing to do right, and I am both frustrated and embarrassed that I managed to mess *that* of all things up; it's the absolute worst word to have misspelled that I can think of - though I am sure there's a few other linguistic hiccups that would have been more embarrassing). What's worse is that I even double-checked that I was spelling the name correctly. But I had written it multiple times throughout the cover letter and the email I had sent it in, and just managed to add that extra C to one of them.

On the other hand...It's a single-letter typo. I would tear into anyone lambasting me or someone else for making any kind of big deal out of someone else's spelling mistake for any purpose other than just correct it. (In a hospital setting or at NASA where lives and millions/billion's of dollars are at stake, I'm a little more sympathetic. This is very much not that.) Trying to use this as a talking point in an interview to extrapolate whether I am attentive to detail is...frustrating, to say the least. I make spelling mistakes at roughly the same rate as any other human, but I make a distinction for one's capacity for details and the average rate we all make typos.

I honestly would have preferred to not know about this in advance, because I've now spent all last night and this morning thinking about, trying to determine the ""best"" response.",8
TIFU by tearing part of the roof off the company truck,t2_5m8ycv2q,"This happened earlier today. I work for a company that uses box trucks for service. Before I go any further, let me preface this by stating that I don't have much experience driving anything larger than a pickup truck and my company knew this when I got hired.

Moving on, while going to unload the truck before moving to our next location on the property, in order to reach the dumpster you have to go under a large tree with a large portion of the trunk hanging over. Thinking I had the clearance and was already past the point needed to make the turn clearly, I turned the truck, but ended up wedging the truck under the hanging part of the trunk. We were able to get it out, but now the truck had a large portion of the roof missing.

Now I sit in anticipation for tomorrow morning to see if I still have a job.

Tl:dr fucked up and wedged the company truck under a tree and tore most of the roof off before getting it out.

Update: still have a job, just gotta deal with a write up so all is well",3
TIFU by adding coffee to my special cake,t2_awz34,"This fuck up started January 1st and continued until yesterday.

My husband got some weed from a friend and since we have pretty much stopped smoking it I baked a cake instead. I have been doing this occasionally for the past couple of years instead of smoking since I don't enjoy smoke and smoking and I like the high better when I eat it. 

This time though, I decided to add some coffee to the mix. My mother in law gave us this nice carepackage as a christmas gift filled with delicious snacks, teas, homemade buns and some special Christmas coffee. The coffee has some orange, chocolate and nut taste. Pretty neat.

I had had a cup or two of this coffee to taste it, but I've actually cut way down on caffeine and actually quit a couple of months ago. I also don't eat a lot of sugar and I try to moderate alcohol. All this is because I have major anxiety and insomnia and I need to be careful about my blood sugar and so on. Since august 2019 I've hyperventilated and almost daily have shortness of breath so my body is telling me pretty clearly to chill out and treat myself better. My husband has also quit caffeine but for stomach reasons mostly.

Well, for some reason I thought it was the best idea to use this coffee that we would  not otherwise drink in the cake. And plenty of it too. It made for a nice wet brownie like cake and tasted delicious. 

Since we're both just home right now, we have been eating this cake everyday for the past four days! Cue surprised pikachu face when I get restless, kind of uncomfortable and can't breathe or sleep properly and not at all last night in spite of eating a goddamn weed cake that usually chills me out. Last night was the worst night. I was really tired and kind of dosed off only to be abruptly awaking by nothing really and then not being able to breathe properly because I can't calm down and then not getting any sleep the rest of the night. And insomnia always makes me feel so sick. Like I'm hung over and got the flu. I'm nauseous and so hungry it hurts without any appetite and I'm so thirsty but have to pee all the time even if I don't drink a lot so its impossible to even rest.

Then today it dawns on me that I totally forgot to google whether the caffeine stays in the cake when you add coffee, so I do and of course I learn that I've been on a four day caffeine bender (oh yes, I microdosed ALL DAY EVERYDAY) instead of having a nice four day chill out after the hassle December is. Awesome. 

I'm absolutely writing this down in my recipe! Never add coffee! 😂
 

TL;DR: put coffee in my weedcake and binged it for four days even though caffeine is really bad for me atm.",4
TIFU by getting a $70 parking ticket,t2_6b3sb1sv,"This story happened to me in February, and since I recently got Reddit I thought I would post about it. I'm a university student, who like many, am very broke. Because of this, I refuse to pay into the scam that is campus parking (it's $1220 for 8 months). They force us to purchase a $350 bus pass as well, therefore, it doesn't make sense for me to pay for a parking pass when I'm forced to pay for the bus. Anyways, onto the story. This one particular Thursday I had a night class and was planning to drive two hours afterwards to visit my boyfriend. I didn't want to pack up the car, take the bus to class, take the bus home, and then drive to see him (I'm also a little sketched out taking the bus at night alone). So I thought what the heck, I'll just risk parking on campus for four hours (this was my first time risking it). I figured that if I got a ticket I would pay the $20 and be on my way. So I drive to campus, park, and walk to get some food before my class starts. I come back to check my car before class and turns out I have a ticket. At a closer look, I realize that the ticket was $70 (another campus scam, in my opinion, the spots are never filled anyways). As I realise fuck up I start freaking out about the price. In the midst of this minor freak out, I ended up locking my keys in the car. Well great, now I'm going to miss class and there was no point in parking on campus in the first place. So I call CAA and they say they will be there in one hour. Two hours go by and I get a call, the CAA guy is lost on campus. About 30 minutes later he finds his way to me. He informs me that because of my older car it is going to be difficult for him to unlock it. So that took about 25 minutes. At this point, I have missed my class and decide to drive up to my boyfriend. On the way there, a raccoon ran out in front of my car on the highway so quickly that I did not have time to get out of the way. I hit it and it cracked the front of my car. I started crying, I felt so terrible. I thought to myself that this day could not get any worse, I was wrong. I got to my boyfriend's and we had to do some car switching so his roommate could go to work in the morning. I offered to back my boyfriend's car out of the driveway. He lives on a busy road so I was so concerned with the traffic that I totally did not see the huge traffic cone at the end of the driveway (not the little triangle ones, the huge striped cylinder looking ones). I heard a crunch and didn't know what to do.  In my fast thinking I decided to continue to roll over it (I later learned that that was a bad idea).  Luckily I didn't total his car I just broke the mudflap. His roommate witnessed the whole thing and now everyone makes fun of me for it. Needless to say, I had a lot of fuck ups that day.

TL;DR - I risked it, parked on campus, got a $70 ticket, locked my keys in the car, hit a raccoon, and drove over a massive traffic cone with my boyfriend's car, all in one day.",8
TIFU by saying an inspirational quote about going blind next to a guy with a glass eye.,t2_njl4r3f,"This actually happened like ten years ago, but I mark it as one of the greatest FU moments ever. 

I was having dinner with friends at a restaurant. At the time I frequently tried to sound smarter by saying inspirational quotes. And I was reading the autobiography of Gandhi. That was my time to shine.
I don't even remeber what was the ""trigger, but I really had to say it: ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"".

All my friends were really impressed by what I just said but somehow I felt that the whole table next to us froze after I said it. I took a look and... I saw him. A guy with a glass eye that was visibly shaken and embarasses.

...sigh.

TL;DR: I said ""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"" next to a guy with a glas eye.

"TIFU by texting a horrible Jewish slur to my friend, who’s Jewish.",t2_1zghk43n,"Well, This isn’t a super long story. I was trying to tell my friend how I like embarrassing them on my Snapchat story. I had posted a photo o her on my private story that I took on a FaceTime call the night prior, captioning it as “why does she look like that?” Obviously it was a joke and she responded with a “dude lol fuck off.” 

I began to type “aw but like embarrassing you on my story :)” perfectly normal sentence. However, the “L” and “K” keys are right next to each other. So, when I’m typing quickly and not paying attention like everyone, I type in the worst possible word to say to my Jewish friend. If you know the word, you know it, if you don’t, replace the “L” in “Like” with a “K.”

I stopped in horror after typing it, did I seriously fuck up that badly on a message? I, out loud, in real life went “oh fuck fuck fuck fuck no” and profusely apologized. Thank god she isn’t mad and understood what happened, she actually found it funny. But Jesus hotboxing Christ I never typed “SORRY” so fast in my entire life. 

TL;DR: Read your texts before you send them, kids.",14
TIFU by licking my orthodontist's hand,t2_5pejvla4,"Yes this happened today, and yes I am still hiding in my room afraid to face other humans. So, I have braces, and I had to get a surgery to fix an impacted tooth. Today I had to go back in to get my wires tightened, and to get another wire attached to yoink down this tooth that ended up trapped on my palate. Basically I have a chain connected to this tooth but it's still under the skin except for a teeny bit of chain.

So anyways, I sit down and she gets started, I pick out a new color and all that jazz. Well, my ortho gets to the area where I had my surgery and begins yanking to her heart's content. Good god, I was in agony. I'm not sure quite what she was doing, but boy it hurt like hell. Well anyways, after far too long of absolutely awful pain, she stops and turns to the plate of torture devices. I assumed that we were done, thank the lord, and out of instinct I went to feel with my tongue to see if the area felt different. (And to make sure that I still had all my teeth)

Here's where the fuck up happens. You see, my tongue is really long and pointy, so it looks kinda funny whenever I move it. Very similar to the Gene Simmons tongue. Anyways, I went to feel the spot and discover that there was something smooth covering it. Being a complete doofus, with my mind hazy from the awful pain, I continued licking whatever was there trying to make sense of the situation.  A few seconds go by and I see that my ortho has a very confused expression. It was her FINGERS! I had been licking her hand repeatedly for the past like 30 seconds. She definitely noticed. I had assumed that she had taken her hand out of my mouth to go mess with the tools, but I was wrong.

I instantly stopped and tried to mutter that I was sorry, but that's tough with a bunch of stuff going on in your mouth. ""We're almost done, just have to cut this piece of chain."" she said. I nearly died inside realizing that I was about to face more pain, and that I was going to have to look her in the eyes again. I still have 2 years of treatment left, fml.

tldr; licked my ortho's hand repeatedly not realizing what it was.",227
TIFU by making my own sex toy,t2_69tocei5,"This afternoon was as normal as any other; I was bored, unoccupied, and most importantly, horny. I decided to change things up from the usual, and because I am too broke to buy a sex toy, I decided to do some research and make my own. After about 15 minutes of trying to find the best one, I made one consisting of a towel, a cup, a rubber glove, and a few rubber bands. I built the masterpiece, found something good, and let it rip. I did the deed and continued on with my day. About fifteen minutes later, I am taking a piss, and I notice my thing is still red at the top, as if I just finished. I touched it, and immediately recoiled in pain. I finished using the toilet and sat in my bed. Another 15 minutes pass, and I decide to get a snack. I get up and immediately feel pain from down there. I look and it is red as a cherry tomato, and whenever anything touches it, it feels I have been stabbed by a knife. It hurts so badly. I lay back down and can’t move, and finally find peace when I take off all of my clothes. I go to my computer to try to find what could have caused this, and as it turns out, I am most likely allergic to latex.

TL;DR: I let my horniness overpower me and discover a new allergy.",11970
Tifu by running away from a guard dog and getting stuck with another one in a room.,t2_6480ffkr,"This happened 2 years ago actually. I was visiting Baños, Ecuador. I had booked a room in one of the hotels. The hotel didn't have its own parking lot so there was a public parking lot across the street and I was told to park my car there for the night. So I went to park and paid the security guard sitting outside by the gate. And I went back to my room. 

A few hours later when I was getting ready for bed, I realized my phone charging cable was in the car, hooked up to the car charger. So I decided to go out to the car to grab it. Went out and saw the security guard wasn't there anymore. I Walked into the parking lot and it was pretty dark, I went to my car and opened door and as I opened it I was still looking around me in the dark, because I was worried about being robbed or something. I noticed a dog sleeping a few meters away from me. I am terribly afraid of dogs, of all kinds, big or small. I slowly grabbed my cable and when I closed the door, the dog woke up and started barking. I didn't know what to do, so I ran!

I ran out of the parking lot with the dog still chasing me, I had hoped it would stop once I'm out of the parking lot, but it still kept following me. I was very close to my hotel but realized I can't stop to open the door the dog is way too close, so I ran past the hotel and kept running. To make matters worse, a few other stray dogs started running after me too. I kept running for about a block and noticed a small shop on my right which had an opened sliding door and I ran in and closed the door. The dogs outside started barking and I prayed for them to leave. The stray dogs left and the guard dog kept barking for a bit but also left after a few minutes. 

I felt so relieved, but was still scared to go out. All this time I hadn't realized that I'm in someone's shop. I turned around and started calling out for someone to come and id explain why I'm actually inside. It was a small room and there was a door that went to the back, but I couldn't see anyone inside the shop. Eventually I started hearing a growl and saw another dog come from the door at the back of the shop and started barking at me. I honestly at that moment felt like I'm in some movie. Because this kinda stuff I've literally only seen happen in movies. I was hating on my bad luck at that moment. This dog was smaller than the previous guard dog but I was still just as scared. 

I turned around and opened the front door and decided to face the first dog if it's still out there because at least I could run from that one. But when I went out, I didn't see the dog, saw the strays but they didn't say or do anything. I went back to my hotel and could barely fall asleep. I was shaking with fear still.

Tldr: I ran from a guard dog and ran into a small shop to hide but only to be in a room now with another guard dog.",12
TIFU By cleaning out my ears with only cotton swabs for 20 years.,t2_37m51srh,"This actually unfolded over the last week, and am still ""enjoying"" the results of my actions..

So for the last few years I've regularly had an itch in my ears. Over the past few months it came as far as having an almost daily itch and I had to clean my ears multiple times a week because of the ginormous amount of ear wax my ears were producing. 

I had been searching for a long time to find an alternative for cotton swabs as I am aware they're not the best but wasn't able to find any (guess I'm an idiot..)

Last week the itching became so bad I started googling again knowing doctors will not be an option for at least 6 more months in my country due to COVID. And so I found an ear spray that is supposed to help dissolve your ear wax while keeping your ears moisturized. Sounds perfect!

I ordered the spray and as soon as it arrived I started going to town. At first the itch immediately subsided. Then.. It became much - and I mean much! worse. Also, any time I'd move my jaw I'd hear a scratchy noise inside my ear...

Finally fed up I took out a cotton swab and was shocked as I pulled out a huge piece of dead skin from my ear. As in.. I didn't even know the inner ear had that much skin surface.. it's like I'm a badly shedding lizard in my ear. Every day I'm pulling out huge pieces of dead skin from my ears and it doesn't seem to stop anytime soon..

So yeah.. gonna enjoy that for a while.. At least my hearing has improved since using the spray.. No more cotton swabs for me..

Tl;dr: Used cotton swabs for years, itchy ears caused me to try out a spray against ear wax. Turns out my ears were itchy from years and years of dead skin buildup. Now my ears are even more itchy from all the dead skin getting unstuck in my ears.

Edit. To all the people asking me in the comments for the product. Check your local pharmacy, they probably have similar products there and will be able to inform you. Best of luck and healthy ear cleaning to y'all!",3365
TIFU by having my car break down 120 miles away from home,t2_4ikrdr6q,"Obligatory, this didn't happen today. This happened two years ago on mothers day sunday. Long story because I fucked up a lot on the way to the ending. 

My parents planned a trip to Viet Nam just because, and needed me to drive them to the LAX. Okay no problem. I argued that we should take my new prius c its more fuel efficient, but my father said that our older prius had a larger trunk that could fit their luggage better. Also my prius c could totally fit all their luggage, but they wanted my little sister to tag along on the ride up so I couldn't put the seats down. So like okay whatever, we'll take the old prius. My dad drives us up to LA all slow and responsibly like an asian father does, he hands me the keys at the airport so I can drive me and my sister back to San Diego. 

I (25 ftm) drive like a total douchbag on account of my toxic masculinity stemming from being trans. I ruined my last car from driving it too fast and ruining the transmission. I didn't learn my lesson then. I take the prius and we take the ramp to get onto the freeway. I do this stupid thing where I accelerate really hard down the exit so I can match freeway speeds by the time I get to the freeway. This aint no sports car, immediately I felt something... slip? it was strange, it was like something in the car slipped and suddenly the prius starts beeping and screaming at me to pull over and it wont accelerate anymore. I thought it was just doing some dumb old car thing, so I tried gassing it a little more and more. No help, I went from 55 to 15 really fast. I pull off in the next exit which was an exit to essentially the middle of nowhere. It looked to be some truck stations and factories and not a SOUL anywhere. My car barely manages to slide into a little neighborhood. I turn off the car and attempt to turn it back on. Car was whole ass dead. 

I was like, alright stay calm, call your dad. Oh wait, I just dropped him off at the airport and is likely in an airplane on his way to ASIA. So I start to slightly panic, but I can't panic because my sister is with me and I'm her role model and I must maintain super cool. I start phoning my friends and looking online of what to do and how to fix this. My phone is starting to die. I can't charge it in my car because it's dead. I decide the only thing I can do is call a tow. I shop around online trying to find the cheapest tow from LA to San Diego. My friend calls me saying that he talked to someone who was willing to drive up to LA to tow me back down to San Diego for 500 bucks. That sounds like a lot, so I said cool I'll think about it. I continue shopping around on the internet to find cheaper alternatives. I figured maybe I could call a tow company and try to see if they can help me for something cheaper than 500. At this point I'm full on panicked because it was hot as hell, my sister was hungry, my phone was dying and the same creep walked by my sister an I for like the 8th time. 

The woman on the phone told me to calm down and that she could send me a tow for $620 and in my panic, I agreed. She proceeds to tell me that there is a $200 fee for cancellation once my car is on the bed of the truck. And I was like yeah yeah yeah. Anyway, dude shows up, has a really bad attitude, takes his time putting my car on his flatbed tow. My sister and I hop into his truck and he's on the phone with the tow company. My phone rings and it's from the tow company, a different woman was talking to me and tells me that i was way under quoted for the job and that it would actually be $875 and I said NO WAY! And she reminds me that my car is already on the bed and that cancellation would be $200. I was furious that they would only tell me that the job would be significantly more expensive AFTER my car was already on the bed. But I didn't have time to argue because my phone was going to die any second. I tell her that I just don't have that much money, I only had $750 in the bank. She very reluctantly agrees. So I get towed back to San Diego for $750 because I panicked and forgot that my friend had found someone willing to do it for 500. 

Finally got home and had an anxiety attack in the safety of my shower but at least I was home. The old prius is still sitting dead in our driveway to this day. We've taken it to many a repair shop but it just keeps dying. Also, I really did only have $750 in my bank account, so I had to buy things using my credit card (i live paycheck to paycheck) until I got paid again and I'm STILL in debt (I also have student and auto loans). Every time I see the old prius (or any silver prius for that matter) I involuntarily break out in sweats and get really light headed. I was told I developed some form of diet PTSD from my experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I drove my prius too fast in Los Angeles and killed it. I panicked and grotesquely overpaid for a tow back to san diego which costed me 750 bucks which is my entire bank account and so now I'm in debt and triggered by silver priuses.",3
TIFU by not reading the Label,t2_5rll4w1c,"Obligatory this happened years ago

the post about moisturizing soaps and real soaps reminded me abut this

i was the girl that always had lotion with her so whenever people needed lotion they would always come to me for it, i got frustrated with giving people all the expensive smelly lotions i liked so i started bringing whatever travel size lotion we ended up having at home.

I hate Olay whenever i use it i just feel weird all over so when i ended up with a travel size olay bottle i resigned myself to not using lotion at school till the bottle was empty but i kept giving it to people, then came the inevitable day that i needed to use lotion and of course i felt worse after using the olay so i went to wash it off but i didn't use the schools soap because i didnt want to further dry out my skin and thats when my face started lathering and becoming all bubbly and i looked at the bottle and it said body wash

TL;DR I gave all my friends body wash to use as lotion",3
TIFU by forcing air into my ear,t2_itidxb9,"This happened last week but since the side-effects seem to have eased I can share it now. I have been using cotton-buds/cue-tips for many years to clean the inside of my ears, I kinda like the feeling of them but recently thought that my hearing may be degraded in my left ear so bought a special syringe to help me irrigate the ears and wash any wax out, I had also been spurred on by suggestions that cue-tips are really bad and force wax deep into the ear.

My ""irrigation kit"" arrived and I read and followed the instructions as I prepared to do the job. The instructions say to force air out of the syringe before drawing in the warm water, I did this then stuck the blighter into my ear (or at least tried to). I gave it a go and did feel water in my ear but not too much, I tried again a couple of times but on one of my goes I pushed the plunger all the way down and despite following the instructions there was a tiny air bubble in there which now got forced down my ear. Right away I felt a bit dizzy and add to that my ear had ""reverse"" popped so was a bit muffled. 

Not really realising what I had done I had another few goes but couldn't unblock my ear. I packed everything away and eventually through moving around realised that I had gone and rammed air into my ear and now pretty much had a little bubble inside my head (or it felt like it). It was weird, if I went up or down the stairs it was almost like the minute air pressure difference was felt in my head, if I leaned over I could feel the ""bubble"" move and it was the same if I lay in bed. I had recently been to the Doctor over a 2 month long headache which has now been identified as a sinus issue, they would have loved me if I went in again. 

Fortunately I didn't have to go back to the docs, it cleared itself one morning when lay in bed I felt and heard a little whoosh from that ear and it popped (though it still feels like there is something in there).

I haven't used the damn thing since and will stick to cue-tips :/

TLDR: Ballsed up when syringing my ears and rammed air into my head, had headache for a few days and won't use the syringe again.",2
TIFU by becoming a slapstick character over a measly $5,t2_10m7s7,"Now that I finally had a little bit of physical cash in my pocket for the first time in a while, I decided to capitalize on a days-old hankering for McDonald's that I'd had. (Yes, I know my body is a dumpster. What of it?)

I ordered my meal, went to the first window, and tried to pay with exact change because of the national coin shortage. As I finally grab my coins in one hand, I give the cashier my dollar bills in the other, and while she grabbed the $1 with ease, the $5 slipped out of both of our hands.

I opened my door to grab it and made mistake #1: I slammed my car door against the brick wall. The bill was just out of reach, though, so then I made mistake #2: I leaned out of the car to grab it, **taking my foot off the brakes**. Now my car was moving forward with my leg still in it, simultaneously pulling me away from my cash and toward the car that was a few yards away at the second window.

So there I am, hopping on one foot to get back into my car before it crashes into another one and this $5 loss becomes a whole insurance thing. As I try to open my car more and slide back in, I continue to slam my door repeatedly against the brick wall, taking off chunks of paint each time. I get back into my own car a few feet before the it hits car in front of mine, then I make a quick third mistake by *immediately pressing on the gas* when I meant to press the brakes. Fortunately, I course correct before we actually collide, so no cars got damaged besides my own.

The first good news is that the van behind me in line saw this whole thing go down and did not pull forward, which would have just made things messier. As things stood, I put my car in reverse and shamefully backed up to the first window again, where the very concerned cashier watched on in horror. I fished out a second $5 bill and handed it to her, and for my troubles she gave me about a $1 discount on the whole meal because I was clearly having a bit of a day. Now, 30 minutes later, I'm finally sitting down to eat with one bloody knuckle, as I apparently punched the brick wall while trying to stop my car.

TL;DR: I dropped $5 on the ground and almost ended up destroying two cars all within 15 seconds.",384
TIFU by giving myself an EXPLOSIVE chronic illness and racking up $1000 doctor bill,t2_93lovnq,"So as per usual this didnt FU didnt start today but I have confirmed my suspicions today. Also sorry if the format is shit, I'm on mobile. 

Last year a couple months into the pandemic I quit my job (another FU but I digress). So after a couple weeks of binge drinking I severely screwed up my sleep schedule. Welp picked up these nice melatonin gummies so I could start getting a proper night of sleep before I started my new job at a butcher shop. Also since I was trying to get my shit together I started the keto diet. 

Fast forward about a week and I wake up to a seriously rumbling, very angry stomach. I go downstairs to go to the bathroom but my fiance is in there taking his morning shit. Theres no other bathroom in the house and I'm yelling at the door for him to hurry up. I'm clenching my butt cheeks but what I think is a fart is coming. It was not a fart. I'm like wtf is happening I'm an adult. 

The next 4 weeks at least I'm having this *problem* everyday, sometimes up to TEN TIMES. Alright I go to google and see if it could be my diet. Yes, Keto poops are a thing so I'm like there we go easy fix start eating normally again. NOPE. still having cramps and explosive relentless diarrhea. 

I decide to go to the doctor to figure this out cuz it's really bumming me out. I miraculously get in that day. They run a covid test, a couple blood tests, and give me an abdominal xray. They also send me home with a stool test. I return the stool test the next day. 

When I get the results everything is negative or normal. All my blood levels are fine, no infection, no infestation of worms. Doctor says schedule a follow up appointment. I'm like alright but then I see my bill. Comes to a little under $1000 dollars. I cant afford to go back. 

I look into all my test results and I guess sometimes the test for worms comes back as a false negative. And I'm like oh the job I started at is a butcher shop that could be it. I bought myself an over the counter treatment for worms thinking that will do the trick. Yet again no.

So now I'm getting stressed. I have IBS or crohn's. Some time later I'm going up to bed and I'm just curiously looking up the side effects of melatonin... YOU GOTTA BE SHITTING ME. *this* is a side effect. I stopped taking it and it stopped happening.

Fast forward to the last week. I'm jobless again and I have succeeded in screwing up my sleep schedule. I guess I'll take one melatonin gummy before bed and risk *the issue* for a good night's sleep.

Well, today I can tell you, it DEFINITELY IS THE MELATONIN! NEVER AGAIN!

TL;DR I spent time and money trying to figure out why I was suffering from chronic *ailment* when I could have just stopped taking melatonin.",73

TIFU by asking my fiancee to inject me with insulin,t2_5r496v,"I still feel SO SO SO BAD for this, just happened 10 mins ago. 

So I'm a type 1 diabetic, I need to take insulin at night and I have gotten so tired with injecting it myself so I asked if he could inject it for me. He obliged and he injected it into my bum. The whole thing went without a hitch. 

Then I had to fart. 

I am wearing a thong and at the time my butt wasn't covered with blankets to shield the smell. I tried to hold it in but it gave me a really really bad tummy ache. I thought about getting up and farting outside my bedroom but I would have farted on the way out. I couldn't hold it anymore so I farted. He was right behind me. Most of my ass exposed since thong. No blanket shield. He recoiled due to the smell and immediately I apologized cuz I knew there wasn't anything I could do to stop it. It all happened so fast. 

Fast forward to now, im in the bedroom, he is groaning on the couch in the living room complaining about how he feels sick, and both of us are laughing our asses off about it. I love him lol

TIFU by teaching my dog how to lick his lips,t2_79o5wvn8,"Since my dog knows all of the basic commands I decided to teach him some funny or cool tricks. One of them was bang (I’m sure a lot of people know what it is) where I pretend to shoot him with my hands and he lays on his side. I was thinking of a unique one and I thought of teaching him to lick his lips. I thought it would be funny so I decided to teach him. Basically I just waited until he licked his lips for a treat then gave it. 

It took about two days to teach and he learned it pretty well. I had family come over yesterday and I showed their kids and they thought it was the funniest thing ever. My dog ended up being alone with the kids and they kept telling him to lick his lips so when I saw him again is lips were super red. I decided to bring him to the vet and by the time we got there he had chapped lips

TIFU by doing 100 squats after not exercising for a year.,t2_13vjrj,"Thats it. Just read the title and you know exactly what i did.

I am a stupid 16yo that did nothing but sit on their thin ass on their desktop all year because covid. I have little to no muscles and i'm weak as hell. 

One of my friends was talking about exercises and how he couldn't get to 100 squats. He said he was too old for it. So my dumbass decided to do 100 squats at once to spite him. Now, i was always great at endurance, but this time it hit different. I also went for a 1 minute long squat for the 20th and the 100th.

When i finished my legs felt nearly dead and my heart beat harder than ever before. I tried to walk afterwards and every once in a while one of my legs would lose some strenght and bend, though i didn't fall.

I am complely fine now but i'm afraid of going to sleep. This is going to hurt like fuck when i wake up. DOMS is no joke. I'll update this post in a few hours after i am done sleeping.

I never squatted before this day btw.

TL;DR : My friend said he couldn't do 100 squats so i decided to go and do it despite not exercising for a year.

TIFU by saving my cat from strangling herself,t2_28pm82we,"In my apartment, I set up a cat tree for my 8 month old kitten right by our window so she could see outside while I was at work. Since I have blinds, my kitten would always bring the blind cords to the top of her cat tree and play with it. One night while I was making dinner, I hear a horrible noise and look over to see my cat dangling from the cat tree by her neck. I frantically rush over and see that she somehow managed to wrap the blind cord at least three times around her neck and her make-shift noose wasn't coming off easily. In the moment, I decided to lift her up to prevent her from hanging, and tried to spin her around to loosen the blind noose (I didn't have scissors nearby). Understandably, she was very scared and amid all the chaos, she bit down on my hand with a force so impressive, I needed to go to the hospital and get stitches. To make matters worse, this is when I discovered I was allergic to cats. Fortunately, she's ok, and yes, I cut off the cords to the blinds and got cheap curtains instead.

TL;DR: I learned a lesson, kittens and blind cords don't mix.",9
"TIFU: No glove, no love",t2_16gejz,"  Obligatory didn't happen today, but happened last Thursday on New Year's Eve. I drive a delivery truck and four days of the week I deliver in the St Joseph, Missouri metro area. I always see the same homeless guy standing at the last stoplight on my way out of town. When I saw him today I read his sign he was holding. It said, ""Homeless veteran, anything you can do will help."" He was wearing an old woodland camo Viet Nam era field jacket. I saw he wasn't wearing any gloves so in my rare fit of benevolence I thought I'd give him a pair of gloves since he was panhandling bare handed in freezing temperatures. I had a brand new pair of black Mechanix gloves I had just bought that morning and I had a nice pair of black Nike Fit running gloves. Both pairs were laying on my dash, so when the light turned green, I idled forward and wolf whistled for him to come up to my passenger window. As I rolled thru the intersection I tossed him a pair of my gloves out of the window which he caught and I went on my merry way. Feeling pretty proud of my self appointed do-gooder status. 
  Two hours later when I get back to my office I docked my truck to take the empty pallets out of my trailer. I grabbed my gloves and lo and behold I had two mismatched left handed gloves. I knew immediately where it all went south. 
TL;DR In summary I tried to do a good deed but fucked it up. So instead of being out one pair of gloves, I'm out two pairs and I'm more than sure somewhere there is a poor dude that thinks I'm a piece of shit.",51
TIFU by using the family camera to take nudes.,t2_5gi4g7n1,"This happened 3 years ago. I (gay M) was 18 and really horny and I had decided to take nudes of myself to boost my confidence. For some reason I thought my own phone wasn't ""good"" enough to take those pictures so I decided to use the camera my mother had bought a few years back. 

I started to do my thing, took a LOT of really nasty pics of myself and after I'm finished, I transferred them to my laptop using the SD card in the camera. I put the camera back where I took it and went back to finish what I had started.

I forgot about it for a time until one day where my mom came to tell me she's going fishing with her boyfriend and she's taking the camera with her just in case they catch something big. I didn't think much of it until i asked myself something : I transferred the pics to my PC, but did I delete the pics from the camera after I put it back ?

I started panicking and kept asking myself if I deleted those pictures or not. At this point it's too late to call my mom back and ask her the camera for a few minutes so I can check and delete them just in case. I spent the entire day making up the worst scenarios I could think of, completely freaked out about it until my mom and her boyfriend came back from their fishing trip. I stayed in my room for about an hour, terrified to get out and face the possibility of my mom seeing her son's asscheeks spread in front of the family camera and 10~ other nasty pictures of all sorts.

After some time my mom came in my room, talked to me like nothing happened at all so I was completely relieved. I thought : ""Either I DID delete those pics or she did not see them yet"" but I still felt better anyways. After they both went to bed I went and checked the camera and there was no pictures of myself to find.

My relief only lasted for a while because the next day I overheard my mother and her boyfriend talking. All I heard of the discussion was ""You kept those pictures?!"" from my mom's BF. I immediately ran to my room, once again completely panicked. I had not imagined this possibility that my mother could have seen those pictures and deleted them without talking about it with me and pretended that nothing happened.

We're a few years later and i moved out of my mom's house and I'm still not sure I deleted those pictures. And I'm still wondering if they were talking about those pictures or not. My mom never brought it up if she saw them and I'm scared to ask her about it out of embarrassment.

TL;DR : I took a lot of nasty pics of myself with my mom's camera and I forgot if I deleted them or not before putting it back.",39
TIFU by letting my gf do my laundry,t2_4toi3a9,"Yesterday, after a long day of driving, my gf and I get to my place and while I’m bringing stuff in from the car she’s getting her cat settled and picks up a bit around the place, on account of her bringing the cat over for the first time. She then goes to start a load of laundry, which I said she didn’t have to do, but she wanted to help out since I had been the one driving. She starts the washer, we make some pizza, and watch some tv. 

After a few episodes I got up to get a drink and she asks me to switch over the laundry, at which I jokingly let out a exasperated sigh and a drawn out ‘fine.’ I go to open the washer and paused when I looked inside. Everything was covered in these weird patches of white, and my first thought wasn’t pleasant. You know those white, strandy egg sacks you see in spider nests? Yeah, gross, and they were covering everything in the washer... But then I saw something else, a teal piece of plastic. Wtf? I pull it out and what do I find? The plastic wrapping for a pack of Angel Soft. The pack I had on the shelf above, with the remaining 1 or 2 rolls of toilet paper, had at some point fallen off the shelf and into the washing machine. Then my gf throws a load of clothes in on top of it without looking. So now all the clothes are covering in damp, half dissolved toilet paper and I break out in laughter. She’s embarrassed, I’m dying of laughter, and my washing machine looks like a Walmart toilet bowl.

There’s no way we were getting all that wet toilet paper off so we start throwing small portions of clothing in the dryer at a time hoping it’ll all catch in the lint trap. It kinda works but a lot still needs to be shaken off and now it looks like it snowed in my laundry room due to the amount of toilet paper dryer lint covering the floor and trailing to my room. Gf keeps apologizing and offering to replace anything while I’m relishing in how much material this has given me to mess with her.  She even bought me some more tp, I just had to make sure it didn’t end up in the wash. I’ll be doing my own laundry for a while now.

TLDR: let my GF do my laundry, unintentionally added an extra ingredient, resulting in my laundry looking like Casper got a little too “friendly” with the load.",59
Today I fucked up by superglueing my tongue,t2_dwcsp,"This happened a few days ago but I was working on putting together a few D&amp;D miniatures and this required some superglue. Fair enough so here I am gluing my things together and there was a slight clog in the tube so I think whatever I’ll just squeeze it hard and it will get pushed though. Well as you can guess it went, oh boy it went, it ended up all over my workspace and some bits got onto my hand. 

Now a regular person would probably just go to the sink and wash it off but apparently I’m super fucking dumb and decided the best thing to do was to lick it off my fingers...

Instant regret! It hardened immediately, though not fully as I tried to scrape it off I touched my teeth to my tongue for a moment which I had to pull apart which was really painful. 

So here I am trying to spit out the glue, hands and fingers sticking together, my housemate next to me laughing at my pain (if it were him then I would do the same. 

Today the last bit ha finally come off and I can taste properly again

Tldr: got superglue on my hands, decided to lick it off like the genius that I am and coated some of my tongue with superglue",16
TIFU by giving my younger cousins weed brownies,t2_8i7fvjd1,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but on on New Year's Eve (12/31). After taking a few days, I'm now able to look back on it with some humor.

On NYE, I decided to bake some weed brownies for myself with around half a cup of ABV that I had accumulated over the past few months. I'd just broken my Pax and was waiting for my Mighty to come in, so I figured why not use the ABV and start anew with 2021. I dumped the entire half cup into the brownie mix and was good to go. After baking, I had the ~~wonderful~~ idea to bring some over to the small family gathering at my aunt's house, where we were having an outdoorsy dinner. 

After arriving, I take out the small container of goods, and my cousins (15, 17, and 20) immediately ask about them. I tell them it's weed brownies, and their eyes lit *up*. At first, I was fully intending to just share some with the 20 year old cousin, but I thought to myself, ""Don't be a scrooge on NYE."" Since I started smoking at 15, I figured I was probably a hypocrite if I told them (15 yo and 17 yo) that they were too young to have any.

I smoke daily, and I low-key forget that tolerance is a concept. However, I figured that since I was using ABV spread across a 13x9"" pan of brownies, each brownie (cut in 1.5x1"" rectangles) would be like maybe 5-10 mg. Pretty easy shit, yeah. After finishing dinner at like 9 p.m., I cracked open the box and everyone took 1 brownie. I ate two, but was fairly sober so I could keep an eye out if anything did happen. 

Check up at around 10 pm on the 15yo in their room playing League. Everything's fine, and they're just feeling a ""full head,"" but other than that, completely normal. 17yo has passed out while watching Criminal Minds. 20yo is pretty much sober, as well, and we all decide to take a brief nap before waking up for the fireworks.

Wake up from the nap to hear my uncle knocking on 15yo's door. He comes down, asks what's wrong with 15yo since they're crying and won't answer any questions. I immediately sober the fuck up and run up to check on them. 15yo is curled up in bed, and my aunt is standing over them, worried. I manage to get everyone out and try to coach my cousin through their high, and it's going poorly. Their head feels like it's about to ""explode,"" and I'm terrified that they'll vomit or something else. Meanwhile, 17yo is pass the point of passed out and is nearly nonsensical. For two hours, I was running back and forth between the two, trying to see if 20yo was feeling any negative effects and checking if the parents are suspicious. 

At around 11:45, I manage to get the 15yo to wash their face and brush their teeth before tucking them in again after midnight. 17yo is now nauseous as fuck and can't get up without the room spinning. I'm panicking at this point and feeling like a sack of shit for causing this to happen. I'm at the point of seriously debating if I can carry 17yo to their bedroom on my back, but they sober up at the very last minute and wobble their way up. The whole time, I'm berating myself. The berating is not helpful in any way.

It's past midnight at this point. I check up again on 15yo (finally sleeping peacefully, thank fuck). 17yo, instead of washing their face and brushing their teeth, has decided to face-plant directly onto their bed, eschewing sheets and blankets and whatnot. That's fine, I can work with that. I wet a rag and wash their face in bed and also remove their chains so they don't wake up with marks on their neck.

Finally, it's over. 20yo and I look at each other, and they ask me to stay the night in case anything else happens. I make up an excuse to stay the night (too drunk to drive home) and stay up all night until 6 a.m. to monitor everyone in case they wake up disoriented and/or scared.

Morning comes. At breakfast, 20yo jokes that I should hand out my brownies at anti-drug school events. Everyone's fine. I go home and pass out at 12 p.m.

TL;DR: I give weed brownies to my younger cousins on NYE. They all have bad trips, and I spend the last moments of 2020 and the first hours of 2021 making sure no one woke up screaming.",54
TIFU by giving my boyfriend a blow job,t2_71znxdjk,"Okay so the topic itself as a whole is NSFW but I’m not going into that much deatail. Also, this happened five days ago but came to a head (no pun intended) today.

So I had never given a blow job in my life and was spending some time with my boyfriend and he’s a great dude and super patient and walked me through what to do. We get into it and i’m like okay not bad I can do this, afterward my throat was hurting and I just assumed it was because it hadn’t had something poke it before and it wasn’t a fan. Some stuff (the sexy kind) happened a few more times over the next few days and my throat still hurt but I was like alright nbd it’s fine, right? Wrong. In so many ways. I had a mild sore throat yesterday and did a precautionary salt water gargle because that’s what you do and figured I would go to sleep and wake up with it gone but boy was I incorrect there. Last night I woke up every time I swallowed because it felt like someone was stabbing my throat. This morning rolls around and I’m like okay fine I’ll go see someone because this is not normal. I get to the urgent care and the doctor told me my tonsils looked “awful” and I have tonsillitis and he’s glad I went in or it could’ve gotten a lot worse. Moral of the story: if you think something is wrong, get it checked out sooner rather than later. If anyone needs me I’ll be eating ice cream. (also babe if you’re reading this, thanks for putting up with me)

TLDR: gave my boyfriend a blow job and mistook tonsillitis for general throat pain",60
TIFU by having too good acting skills as a kid,t2_nnu5a,"This was many years ago and it's kind of fuzzy now but here goes.

I was at this summer camp and the councellors decided we would put on a play. It involved the wolf and the three pigs fable. But this play was unique because it was a play within a play. I was given the acting role of ""director"" in which my job was to randomly stop the play at intervals, shout at the characters about their lines, and change the scenery with a wave of my hand. Idk it was super weird but that's what it was.

They gave out notebooks with lines to everyone and it was our first read through. So I was getting to a part in the script where it was my turn to speak and ""be evil"". And so I went with it, insulting the wolf and three pigs, as per the script. I perhaps did it too convincingly. I remember getting death stares from the councellor watching backstage, and being confused because I was just reading my lines. She dragged me off the stage later and raged at me about manners and how I needed to control my temper. I was barred from participating in the play, and barred from participating in other camp activities afterwards.

I was a quiet kid and I was too freaked out by getting in trouble that I never admitted that I was actually just speaking lines the whole time, and that I had mistakenly read the script out loud from the wrong page, when everyone least expected it.

TLDR: Was in a play and was given a script. I mistakenly read my lines out loud from the wrong page. Convinced everyone I was talking for reals, and a total asshole. Got kicked out for being rude. Was too scared to admit I was actually just reading lines the entire time.",29
TIFU by masturbating,t2_5i1burmb,"So I (16f) started recently using a menstrual cup. It was in tonight, no problem. It was around midnight and I couldn’t sleep, so I wanked and came twice. 

Now you know how when you cum, your vaginal walls sort of clench? Well mine do. And when I was checking wether the cup was still there, I had a mini heart-attack because I couldn’t find the antenna. I then found it but it was way deeper than it should be. 

I went to the bathroom, panicking, thinking ”oh crap did my vagina swallow a cup do I have to go to the ER oh shit oh shit oh shit”

After 10 of wiggling, tugging, pleading and pulling, I got the fucker out and put it back in. Crisis averted but man that was a close call. 

tl;dr wanked while wearing a menstrual cup, vaginal walls clenched and shoved the cup very deep into my vagina. Took 10 mins to get it out.",42
TIFU!!!!!! Almost started a nuclear war with Pakistan!!!!,t2_9bwds9d9,"TIFU!!! I was reading comment chains on a post and someone mentioned the Pakistan Armed Forces that worship the Islamic Religion.

They call them selves Jihadists.

The guy in the comments was talking about an Islamic Militant that used his Pakistani funding to turn himself into a terrorist, and these people made dangerous ideas with their religion even after being asked not to.

I found this to be disturbing, knowing I can not believe everything I read in comments, I wanted to see if this was true.

Well, after long personal investigation I found their deep website and clicked on it.

It was bad, Pakistani propaganda everywhere.

before I could even comprehend what I was looking at, police walked into the computer store and asked ""WTF ARE YOU LOOKING AT""...

It took about an hour to explain to him what I was witnessing and to convince him I was not a Pakistani spy. It was embarrassing

F those dudes.

TL:DR, I think I saved the world. NTA",0
TIFU by throwing a slug at my husband,t2_2w08ixef,"So background: we have two dogs an older Rottweiler and a young mastiff puppy.  Both dogs are fed on raw and as this tends to get a bit messy we usually feed them outside.  

So to my fuck up.  My husband had disappeared a while ago out the side door (solid wood) to go to the gym set-up we’ve cobbled together in our garage since U.K. lockdown means no actual gyms are open to get in a bit of a workout.

The program I was watching on tv ended and I decided it was doggy dinner time (well that and the plaintive looks I was getting from them) so I headed outside to grab their dinner bowls, through the back door into our garden, where it was pitch black on the patio.

As I get into the utility room (near the side door), where we keep their food I spotted a slug in one of their bowls.  Now with lungworm on my mind I wanted to get it out so I could clean the bowl before feeding and because I am a bit of a softy for creepy crawlies (except wasps they can sod off) I thought I’d quickly throw the slug back outside free to live another day through the nearest door.

From my husbands point of view he was just heading in knackered and sweaty from a thorough workout session when his loving wife kindly opened the side door for him before throwing a large slimy slug in his face!

On the positive side he was already heading to the shower before the slug juice made it imperative!  

Tldr: as title - next time I’ll look before I throw rescued slugs back outside!",70
TIFU by getting a covid test at the wrong place.,t2_5ud09m46,"I worked at a hole in the wall restaurant off the gulf coast in mid-Louisiana. We are in an area highly susceptible to hurricanes. For Hurricane Delta, the water rose up to the ceiling on the first level. I went back to work after about a month of cleanup and re building. A week or two later one of my coworkers tested positive when her high school opened back up. All 4 employees and the manager was forced by the owner to get tested. The manager and other 3 employees were mother/daughter/son/niece (respectively), so they all got tested together. The owner told us all he would pay us back for the test whatever the cost. The family of workers’ tests costed $55 each, which I was not aware of. I went to one of the other urgent cares to get my test, which turned out to be $345 because my insurance wouldn’t cover it due to me having no symptoms. After 2 weeks of quarantine, the joint finally opened back up. When I would ask about getting repaid, which I was very open about the cost with them right when I was charged, the manager floundered about the idea another week and a half. I texted the owner himself so I could see about getting my money back, he told me they are “literally giving away free tests all over (city nearish me)” and told me he’d pay me a $55 copay. I texted back saying he could keep his $55 copay and I would no longer be working there. He texted back later and gaslighted me saying he would pay the $345 “not because of the message above but because i want to.”

I’m 17 and currently unemployed because of this. It’s hard to find a job around my area and especially at my age, and most of all working with my schedule being a high school senior.

Was I in the wrong for quitting on the spot or should they have been more than willing to be true to their word and pay me whatever cost the test was like they said they would?

TL;DR : I was forced to get tested for COVID by my workplace and was promised to be repaid for it, but was rejected when my test was too much.",12
TIFU by sleeping naked on my couch.,t2_2cbbryzq,"I am going to keep this short and sweet. This happened early this morning.

Backstory: Husband's BFF stays at our house every weekend. He 100% of the time opts to sleep in the living room opposed to the spare room. This man sleeps through *everything.* 

I've been a sleepwalker since I was a child. I've never been concerned about this because it's mild at best and makes for some funny finds in the morning. Most recently, I found an empty liter of cola in the glassware cabinet and one dresser drawer rummaged through. I have many sleepwalker stories, but that's not why we're here.

The Event: BFF passed out on our recliner around 9pm. Absolutely normal behavior for him. Husband and I watched an episode of Virgin River on Netflix and then went to our room for sleeps.

We did the dirty, I cleaned up and flopped into bed in my (quite skimpy) underwear. 

Fast forward to 1:30am. I wake up ON THE COUCH still in my underwear. I'm snuggled up with a baby blanket that is not doing me any favors. BFF is no longer on the chair; which means something disturbed his hibernation sleep. I hear the bathroom fan running so I dart to my bedroom (blankie in hand) and after a quick bout of shame and quilt I go back to sleep.

I told my husband first thing in the morning that I woke up in the middle of the night practically naked and somehow woke up BFF. He didn't seem phased by this.

NOBODY SAID ANYTHING while we were all getting ready to leave for work.

Husband and his BFF work together, so i'm interested in learning if he had said anything during the day.

TL;DR pretty sure husband's BFF saw me naked.",35
"TIFU by thinking ""dipshit"" wasn't a swear word.",t2_58cufmy7,"This happened when I was 11.

My (much older, strict) sister was at my mom's. My nephew (9) stayed over with us.

We watched ""happy gilmore"" on VHS (appropriate, right?)

There's the scene where the guy is trying to throw Happy off his game and keeps calling him ""dip shit"".. naturally, I started saying it.

He quickly stopped me and said

 ""that's a bad word! I'll get in so much trouble, stop saying that!""

So I kindly explained to him that it's not a swear word because there's ""dip"" in front of it, so it's obviously a different word.

We watched the movie probably 3 more times that night, and kept calling each other ""dipshit"" or putting it at the end of every sentence the entire night.

The next morning, his mom is there when we wake up... She yells in my room

 ""boys, wake up""

We wake up, being young we were just naturally wide awake as soon as our eyes open.

We go out to the table for breakfast, his mom says 

""Good morning, sweetie.""

He replies in a very upbeat and loud 

""Good morning, dipshit!""

Her mouth dropped and she never let him stay over again.


TL;DR: convinced nephew ""dipshit"" wasn't a swear word &amp; he called his mom dipshit, got in trouble and never stayed over ever again.",64
TIFU by oversleeping for over an hour and missing something important,t2_4sd224kx," For a bit of back story, my son and I are disabled and my partner works 6am-4pm Monday to Friday. I can't drive so we're a little restricted with what we can do. For years now we've had our groceries delivered and, due to Covid, not only is this more important delivery slots fill up fast. I usually order for delivery on Monday between 9am and 10am.

So recently, I've been oversleeping in the morning as I'm not sleeping well. I usually subconsciously remember on a Monday but today I slept right through the delivery. The problem is, there is no way I can get it delivered another day so I have a choice, even make my partner do it, which he will never let me forget (and is harsh), or drag my boy out tomorrow and get a taxi to the nearest store (over 3 miles away) or starve for 2 weeks. Tomorrow's going to be tough but I'm just wondering how much my partner is going to rant and rave when he gets home tonight. 

Totally my fault, did not need this and I feel so bad! However I blame the pandemic for there being no slots this week I can rearrange it for.

Edit: I manage to arrange to have it come later but not only is my partner mad at me for missing it in the first place, I forgot to get cheese. Apparently, me suggesting he pick some up on the way home from work is unreasonable after he's been up for twelve hours. Well excuse me.

 

TL;DR I missed the delivery of groceries this morning and there are no slots for two weeks. My partner is going to blow his top!",3
"TIFU and learned why the coffee tasted a little, ""off""...",t2_890cf,"K, this happened 12 years ago. I was in the process of moving to the city and my mom gave me a sort of Apartment Starter Kit, old pots, pans, utensils, plates, etc. Including an old [Tim Horton's coffee maker](https://i.imgur.com/PxP13lJ.jpg), which had been stored in the shed for a couple years.

Not being a dummy, I cleaned out that coffee maker as best I could, then ran a few straight pots of water / vinegar through it. It ran a bit slow but I wasn't too worried. ""Good coffee takes time!""... Or so I thought. My first cup of coffee tasted a bit strange. I quickly attributed that to any lingering vinegar.

Fast forward a week or so later and the taste of the coffee hadn't improved, + the speed of the brew was noticeably slowing. So I decided to take it apart and give it a more thorough cleaning. I'm fairly mechanically inclined, so I was able to break it down with little effort. Feeling proud of myself, I accessed the water reservoir and emptied it. What came out was a sort of dark grainy sludge. At first I was annoyed, wondering ""How did coffee grounds get into the water reservoir?!"" As I stared at the sludge, my annoyance slowly turned into revulsion and horror. Yes, while stored out in the shed, mice had made my Mom's Tim Horton's coffee maker their home. And I had been brewing and drinking Mouse Turd coffee.

TL;DR I unknowingly drank mouse turd flavoured coffee for over a week.",4151
TIFU by telling a customer they're bad at their job,t2_oargu,"This happened a couple of years ago, but is by far the biggest fuck-up I've ever committed.

I was working in a cinema at the time and Avengers: Endgame was out. I was working the day shift in the week so it was relatively quiet. A woman came out of her Avengers screening complaining about the sound balance. I went to check in the screen and the movie sounded normal. So I went to check the sound level on the speakers and they were all set to the normal levels.

I came back and explained to the woman that all of our levels were normal. She insisted that they weren't. Now, I'm somewhat of a movie buff and have noticed a trend in recent years of action films having really poor sound mixing. The dialogue is usually too quiet and the action too loud. I don't know where this trend came from, but everyone seemed to finally realise when Tenet came out and they couldn't hear a damn thing anyone was saying.

So, I said to her that that's just how Endgame sounds. That for whatever reason, the sound mixers made the dialogue too quiet and that I find it to be a really annoying stylistic choice in modern filmmaking.

The look of rage that engulfed her face cannot be described. I don't think I've ever seen someone go from 0-100 on the anger meter that fast.

""I *AM* THE SOUND MIXER!"" she said. Turns out she worked at Pinewood Studios and was the person responsible for what I had just described as bad sound design to her face.

She went on a whole tirade about how she knows more than me as I just had to stand there and take it. I still stand by my belief that the sound mixing in Endgame was not good, but I never thought I'd end up saying that to the person responsible for it.

TL;DR Was working at a cinema and a customer complained about Endgame being too quiet. I told her the sound mix was bad, turns out she was one of the sound mixers for the movie.

EDIT: I am talking about Pinewood Studios in London, England, not the one in Atlanta, Georgia.

EDIT 2: There's no need to call her a bitch, guys, I've had far more hostile customers, believe me. Maybe she was just having a bad day. I'm sure she's a nice person.

EDIT 3: Please stop suggesting that I should have taken her to personally inspect the equipment. I would have been fired for breaking a myriad of rules. It was a no-win situation.

EDIT 4: The cinema in question wasn't far from several major production studios and several high-profile location sites for big Hollywood movies. So the odds of me serving someone who worked on Endgame (which was partially made essentially down the road from me) are actually pretty high.

EDIT 5: She might have worked at Shepperton Studios, which is next to Pinewood. I'm honestly not sure which one it was.

FINAL EDIT I PROMISE: I fully acknowledge that she knows more about sound mixing than me or most of the people in this thread. However, as consumers, we have a right to voice our opinion if we don't like a product. The fact that the VAST MAJORITY of the commenters agree that action films nowadays are way too loud in some places and quiet in others shows that there is clearly a problem. You don't have to be a professional chef to know if your food tastes bad, and you don't need to be a professional sound mixer to know if a movie sounds like trash.",31622
TIFU by thinking r/trees is a subreddit is about cool tree pics...,t2_6aghudgp,"I wake up this morning to get a notification that my phones storage is to full. so I went to sort threw my thousands of photos.

TIFU by watching a horror movie and scaring myself so much I can't sleep,t2_9nfibsox,"This did happen today and now I feel very stupid. 

Together with a friend I decided to do a good old fashioned horror movie night ( In my country you can see up to two people per day). We ended up watching a story about a couple living in a haunted house. The ghosts lived the walls, so there were all kinds of thuds, and scratching sounds, and whispers that developed into screams, and so on. 

It turned out to be a pretty decent horror movie and the buildup and graphics were amazing. Only problem is that it is now 1:15 at night and I can't sleep because suddenly all the normal sounds in my house are of course coming from the ghost. And all that while tomorrow is the only day this week I actually have to be up bright and early. So stupid. So now I'm trying to sooth myself with episodes of Winnie the Pooh, but so far no luck.

TIFU by sending profesor 159 page long cheat sheet,t2_13ne1y,"
today my unluckiness hit all time high. today i had a ancient history final, i was supposed to write a half page of text on 3 out of 80+ headers(subjects).
 i spent month learning for this test, i went throu every answer with internet and read a book which has everything i could be asked about. basicaly i had never spent more time to get ready for a single 45min task. while i was preparing i with my fellow students created a 159 page book with all the answers so if anything we can just quickly check answers and i saved this file under name Ancient History test, Name Surname. well 2 days before test i recived a message that during the time of final exam the home will be cut of from electricity (its covid time so everything has to be done from home) to manage that i created a whole setup so professor can see me and i can write and internet is working without eletricity and thus i had to use my laptop which i use so rearly after the lockdown i needed to use my other keyboard just to write. Anc then i had everything ready and they didnt cut the electricity so i was in position of having unfamiliar pc, unfamiliar e-mail (why outlook), and poorly named files. well today after writing the best work i could i realized i have 1 minutes left to send in the work and so i did send the professor, who is well known for hating cheaters with passion, a file named Ancient history test. name surname. but because the panick and my immense stupidity i sent him what one could call a cheat book. well now after he sent me message saying what he had recived i would like to say, dont be like me check the work at least twice because all the work and my credibility has gone, and yet i ,now empty husk of a man, will try to live with myself if i'm not thrown out of this university i had been working for since 5th grade.
TL:DR
i sent a professor 159 pages of cheat sheets and not my final exam work
P.s.
 (those pages were used in my fellow student work too so if professor checks i might have destroyed their work too as they said that they pasted and edited just a bit. Which would suck even more as i dont think i can handle ruining something for others with my dumb existance )
I'm sorry for post's grammar and structure its not my strong side :(",24
TIFU by driving my new (to me) car,t2_7c5yj7xf,"Background: I (15f) have been learning to drive (I have my learners permit), so my caring yet cheap dad decided to get me a car. I knew that he wasn’t going to get me a new car and I didn’t expect him to, but the car (2007 Honda Civic hybrid) he bought was in really rough condition. The main problem was that the transmission needed to be replaced. He finally finished replacing it this weekend. He got the license plate this afternoon, and I was thrilled because I would finally be able to drive it! The main reason I even needed a car was so I could drive it to my youth orchestra rehearsals. I usually drive my sister’s car, but she gets home from school later than I need to leave for rehearsal, so I am almost always late by just a few minutes. Now that I had my own car, I could leave earlier and I wouldn’t have to worry...or so I thought.


Fast forward to about 3:30 this afternoon. My dad and I are getting ready to leave (I still have to have an adult in the car with me when I drive because I only have my learners permit). Rehearsal starts at 4:45 and it takes about 40 minutes to get there, but traffic is usually pretty heavy so it takes longer. My dad originally wanted to leave around 3:45, but he needed to stop by the bank, so we left at 3:30. I start the car up and back up the driveway so that I can get to the road. The first thing I notice is the terrifying rumbling and shaking that occurs when I put the car in reverse. My dad said it was fine, so we went out onto the road. The next thing I noticed was how bumpy it was. Again, my dad blew it off and said that it was probably just a fixable problem with the tire. We finally got to the highway and I noticed ANOTHER problem. The car was really sluggish when you pushed the gas at first. My sister’s car accelerates very quickly, so it was a little concerning to think about since my sister has practically the same model of car. The reason it was so slow was because the battery wasn’t charging. I don’t know anything about how hybrid cars are supposed to work, but I do know that when you put on the break, it should charge at least a little bit. But the green bars on the gauge that show when the battery is charging did not light up and the gauge that showed the battery charge only had one little bar.


I kept driving while my dad, in the passenger seat, fumbled around with the different features. The biggest difference between my car and my sister’s car is that mine has a little touch screen navigation thing in the console. My dad really liked it and was trying to figure out how to use it when the screen turned off. He chocked it up to loose wiring and I could tell he was a little disappointed. A few minutes later, the lights on the air conditioning buttons, just below the navigation screen, shut off too. That’s when the real issues started arising. While going around a slight curve, I felt that the steering wheel was really difficult to turn. I decided not to worry about it though, because I still had a long way to go before I had to turn.


I came to a stop at a red light on the highway. There are several stores along the road. I pulled up a little bit as the person in front of me started to move, but when I looked down at the dash, the whole display was flickering. My dad told me to pull off at a gas station and I did, even though I struggled to turn the steering wheel. I switched places with him and he drove to an auto parts store just down the road. The car was lurching, the display was flickering, and it wouldn’t go over 5 mph. He was able to buy a new battery and replace it quickly. It was about 4:15 at this point and I was convinced that we wouldn’t make it in time. 


My dad drove the rest of the way (thankfully, as my legs were shaking really bad from the adrenaline), and miraculously, we made it on time! I’m so glad that we left early or else we would have been really late. As for the car, it still has lots of problems. There might be a problem with the axle and I think my dad said something about the alternator being the reason the battery wasn’t charging.


Sorry if this is written badly, I just thought it was funny how many things went wrong, yet I still made it on time.


TL;DR: I drove the car that my dad recently repaired to rehearsal, the battery died on the way, but I still got there on time somehow",12
TIFU by trying to get rid of my erection,t2_33aajfqy,"Today I had morning wood. In order to save myself the embarrassment of leaving my room with an erection, I pulled up a gay porn video on my computer because that was the only surefire way to get rid of it. Unfortunately, I spent so much time worrying about leaving my room with an erection that I completely forgot to lock my door, and my mom walked in on me watching gay porn while I held my erect penis (in order to feel the erection diminish in real time). Now, not only has my mom seen my erect penis, she also thinks I’m gay and no matter how many times I tell her the real reason I was watching gay porn she refuses to believe me. 

TL;DR I watched gay porn to get rid of my erection and now my mom thinks I'm gay when literally the opposite is true.",708
TIFU ny getting too close in golf,t2_8efbixts,"I was at my neighbors/friends house and sinceher older brother was shooting a bow and arrow (We both would have joined but he is a jackass so we didn't), we decided to play golf. Now, I had never done ""real"" golf,so i was new to using a driver. Here is the fuck up. My friend told me to back up because she was going to swing and show how to use a driver. So i back up maybe three feet or so,she looks back and gives me a thumbs-up and prepares to swing. Sneakily i come right behind her and she swings. POW!! The club comes right over my eye to my eyebrow and clobbers me in the head, I scream and fall down, sobbing, bleeding, all the while my friend yells, "" I'M NEVER GOING TOUCH THESE GOLF CLUBS AGAIN!"" Like that was going to happen. By the time I get to my house (We were neighbors so that helps) I'm joking with my parents and they're taking pictures and stuff. We get some ice and head to the hospital so I can get my first ever stitches (yay..) and get some Mc Donald's after. At school my friends are like oh no what happened and all the sorts and all I have to say is [friends name] hit me with a golf club.

TL;DR At neighbors house and get hit in the head with golf club, later eat Mc donalds and obviously blame it on my friend",0
TIFU By Almost Burning My House Down,t2_6csi9sre,"The original fuckup was not today, but it took a while to come to a head, so hold onto your hats. On the upside, this is not sex related!

I bought a house earlier this year, which I am very proud of. Along with that has come lessons in homeownership, like the one I just learned.

I'd been out of town for the weekend, and paid my brother to watch my dogs for me. He brought them back around 10 pm, we chatted for a few minutes, and he departed. I went back to my room to watch the latest episode of Mandolorian.

Around 10:30 or so, the power in the bedroom suddenly went out. It's an older house and a lot of the downstairs is on the same circuit, so I figured I'd just overloaded it somehow, which has happened several times. I went to check the breaker box and turn the power back on.

The following is what happened to the best recollection of my stressed memory:

I tried to flip the breaker, but the lights didn't turn back on. The breaker also didn't want to stay on. I heard what sounded like a weird popping noise though, and wondered if an animal has gotten into the wiring and chewed through something/electrocuted itself. I went in the direction of the sound, and started to smell a little smoke. Thought this confirmed the animal theory. I then walked into the next room, and it was **full** of smoke. I turned around to run back and turn all the breakers off, when I saw a light coming from under the door of my utility closet. Full of dread, I checked the doorknob for heat, then opened the door.

My utility closet was on fire. 

I flew back around the corner, turned off every single breaker, and began running around looking for a bucket while calling 911 (US emergency number). I remembered I had a bucket sitting right outside the front door from where I'd dispatched and disposed of a snake recently, so I grabbed it, filled it full of water, and threw said water into the closet while holding the phone to my ear with my shoulder and maneuvering around two dogs who had no idea what was going on except that mom was running in circles, things smelled weird, and this was great fun. The 911 operator informed me that I should not attempt to put it out myself and should instead get myself and my animals out of the house, but the first bucket had put about half of it out, so I promptly ignored her and threw another bucket onto it because I'll be damned if I was going to let my new pride and joy burn down if I could do something about it while the fire was still relatively small. Satisfied that it appeared to be out, at least on the surface, I hauled the animals outside to wait for the fire department.

Fortunately the fire station is not far from my house, and they rolled up within a few minutes. They confirmed the fire was in fact fully out and not still smoldering somewhere, were properly sympathetic, then commenced an investigation. I was standing outside discussing dogs with one of them when the fire chief came outside and summoned me to come look at something.

I walked inside, and he held up a small gasoline (petrol) can. 

...

While doing yardwork over the summer, I had been leaving most of the equipment - *including the gas can* \- sitting in the front room. This shares a wall with the utility closet. The operative theory of the fire department is that when my brother brought the dogs back, one of them knocked over the gas can, which still had some gas in it. The gas rolled out of the can, along the floor, under the wall, and down into the utility closet (which while accessed from the first floor, extends into the crawlspace). When the water heater next kicked on, it ignited the fumes from the gas, which traveled to the gas itself, then to the wood beams it was on...you get the picture. Thankfully it burned through the wiring early on, and while I was still awake.

I got a shaming lecture from the fire chief about bringing gasoline into the house, even to keep it out of the rain, and how I needed to just get a small storage shed to put those things in. I did not shamefully admit to the fact that I already have a storage shed, and just forgot to put the gasoline in it like an idiot because it's on the other side of the yard.

I then slept on a blanket pallet in the dining room for the next few days because it and the kitchen were the only rooms that still had electricity, and also I was paranoid and afraid to be too far away from the utility closet in case it spontaneously combusted. 

For what it's worth, the dogs also thought floor camping was great.

Tl;dr: Left gasoline in my house like an idiot, someone knocked it over, fumes caught fire, almost didn't have a house anymore.",36
TIFU by getting a covid test,t2_3t017y5k,"This happened about a month ago at this point but whatever

Some time ago someone at my work got covid and due to that I wanted to get a test to make sure I didn’t have it due to them and to make sure I wouldn’t infect anyone else. While I was waiting for my test results I of course had to stay home so I emailed my manager to not schedule me and to give away my upcoming shifts and she wasn’t happy about it at all, I apologized and told her there wasn’t a lot I could do about it and I wanted to make sure I wouldn’t infect any coworkers or customers.

After I got my test results I emailed her saying that I was negative and ready for work.... no shifts, I think that maybe she missed my email so a few weeks later I email her again telling her I’m emailing again incase she missed my last email but she emailed back saying she saw it.... still no shifts, turns out she’s not scheduling me at all because I had to stay away from work for a bit while I waited for my test results.

TLDR: Someone at work got covid so I went to get a test and needed to stay away from work while I waited for results, my manager didn’t like that and now won’t schedule me anymore",176
TIFU by sending the Fanfiction that I was writing to our GC,t2_803wx4wi,"So I(15F) is a member of our class GC. The GC was mainly used to send Zoom class links, activities, and important notices. All our teachers including our Principal are also in this GC. 



We were having our Physical Education class today and my mom told me not to attend as I have a hangover. (I drank Soju with my parents instead of our usual red wine not thinking that it would hit me so hard when I wake up. The soju was 350 ml and I drank half a bottle of it as it was very fruity. The soju hit me so hard that my parents wanted me to just rest but I insisted on going to classes as I didn't wanna miss anything important.)  So we were having classes and it was Off Cam so I was listening and at the same time, writing fanfiction. The fanfiction that I was writing had a kiss scene in this chapter and I wanted it to be a little spicy so I was editing and adding words and I finished writing it when our classes also finished. I took screenshots of it and sent it to the GC, not realizing that I sent it there first. When I looked at where I sent it, I panicked. I panicked to the point that our housemaid even got worried. I opened our GC and unsent the photos a few minutes after I sent them. 



The first persons who saw the photos were my two female teachers. I'm waiting for one of them to scold me but they didn't even say anything! No ""Don't do it again"" or ""Remove this immediately! What if the Principal sees this?!"" Just silence.



Now I'm just waiting for the scoldings and lectures to come. But no one said anything. This got me more worried and I won't be attending classes later as I'm still panicking. I just hoped they didn't have wifi or data so they won't see what I wrote but everyone has been silent.



Also, the last time my classmates sent something so ridiculous to our GC, they got scolded by the Principal himself and I'm scared if that will happen. Our Principal is strict hates any romantic talks, writings, or anything related to romance when it comes to us, his students. He sees us as children and doesn't want us exposed to anything related to romance as we're still young. 



TL;DR I accidentally sent the Fanfiction that I was writing in our GC and I'm still waiting for my teachers to say something.",4

TIFU by ordering some flowers,t2_f7p3j,"Actually happened today!

  


My cousin lives in France. She messaged me yesterday asking if I could help her send some flowers from a local florist to grandma to be delivered today as it's her birthday. I thought it was a bit odd as grandma is JW and doesn't celebrate birthdays but hey, I'm just a go between.

  


We discussed budget and messages and I arranged for some flowers to be delivered, saying that if the shop couldn't do same day delivery I'd ask my dad to drop them to grandma as he'd surely make an effort to visit her on her birthday (they both live alone and are in a bubble). My cousin mentioned something about it being out the way, which confused me slightly as it's not at all, but I assumed it's just because she hasn't visited in years and was a bit confused about where things were.

Cousin messaged me again this morning asking if I want the address, to which I thought ""of course not, I lived there for years!"" and assured her I knew the address.

  


Fast forward to this afternoon, grandma received the flowers and is overjoyed. She sent a photo of them to our family group chat and it made her day. She was so happy.

  


I instantly got a message from my cousin

  


""the flowers were meant to be for my other grandma...""

  


What followed was at least 30 minutes of absolute hysterical laughter. Turns out MY grandma's birthday was actually yesterday, and my cousin's grandma had her birthday today (but more have been ordered for her to be delivered tomorrow!). Looking back on the conversation I can clearly see that me and my cousin were talking about different people and completely ignoring the red flags in each others responses. The intended recipient of the flowers was only referred to as ""grandma"" and nothing else.

  


I CANNOT stop giggling. Every time I see the photo of the flowers, I start laughing again. Naturally, the intended grandma will not receive her birthday flowers today. The unintended grandma is none the wiser and thinks it was just a random gesture. My cousin is £60 out of pocket. All's well that ends well!

  


TL;DR - shared grandma's make for tricky conversations",21
TIFU by trying to ring in the New Year with some bubbly,t2_6df548ym,"Didn’t happen today but the after effects have been ongoing until now... 

Being a particularly glum end of a very sad holiday season in 2020, I decided I would get some moderately priced champagne and celebrate it right! The clock struck 12 and I had the bottle ready as my plan was to get drunk and binge Netflix all morning until I fell asleep to the sun coming up. Usually it’s not very hard to remove the cork; I can typically just yank it off without much effort but this one was a bit stubborn. I used an overpriced pampered chef champagne cork remover thing I purchased and maybe only had the opportunity to use twice hoping to get a better grip on the thing. The device has scary looking metal teeth on a handle that only succeeded in ripping off the top of the cork, so I was left with a broken cork and nothing to drink to bring in the New Year. 

I was VERY determined to keep to my plan so I Googled different ways you were supposed to open the bottle now - used an icing/hot water trick, the shoe thing, pushing it down to get it loose - but nothing seemed to get the thing to budge! It says specifically NOT to use a corkscrew but I thought, “what the heck” I’ll just be sure to keep it pointed well away from my face or anything breakable in my kitchen. I managed to get the screw portion in a few turns and pulled with all my strength!! This only resulted in me pulling off the top of the corkscrew, which fell into the sink and broke one of my favorite mugs. So now I had an unopened bottle, a broken corkscrew, a broken mug, and an ever growing obsession to get this bottle open and save the rest of my evening. 

Another less preferred method, because booze and sharp objects do not mix, is to use a small flat knife to try and wedge it between the cork and the bottle. This only led to pieces of the cork crumbling off and making it even more difficult to pull the thing out. So I just go for it and start jamming the knife in there in an attempt to push the cork into the bottle. I give myself a good wind up and proceed to jab the knife directly into the knuckle of my thumb and the pain and blood pooling out of my finger is instantaneous and massive. I run into the bathroom trying to find some first aid materials and turn my sink into an episode of “Forensic Files” while I splash alcohol and wrap the thing with paper towels. After the bleeding stops and I’ve found something I can use as a bandage (I put a scrap of paper towel on the cut with some bacitracin and secured it with an anti-snoring nose strip), I return to the bottle (it’s about 2:45am now). At this point, I am angry and wounded and NEED a win to start my 2021. I do finally succeed in pushing the rest of that fucker in the bottle and “enjoy” a cork filled flat glass of bubbly before calling it a night at around 3:30am. 

Later that evening, I decide to venture out for some proper first aid supplies and drive about a block or so to CVS. I load up on junk food, bandaids, and gauze and head back home. It started to ice but I wasn’t worried, I only live a few minutes away. The road was a bit slippery and I hit a pothole a little too quickly and pop my front tire. I had to work the following day (Saturday) so I get up early, find a local service station and beg them to put on my donut so I can get to work. Thankfully my luck is shifting by this point and I get to work with 5 minutes to spare and arrange to get a new tire installed before the shop closes at 5pm. So all told, it cost me about $180 in damages and a still aching finger to have that one terrible glass of champagne on New Years. Here’s to 2021, friends!! 

Tl;dr: In an attempt to get drunk on New Years Eve/Day, I break a ton of shit, stab myself, and get a flat tire trying to go for first aid supplies in an ice storm.",41
TIFU by using the same shampoo for as long as I can remember.,t2_340tafm6,"
This is an ongoing fuck up that I only recently learned was an issue. Yes I know, I am the definition of an idiot. Here we go.

So I’ve been using the same shampoo and conditioner for as long as I can remember. I never thought anything of it, it’s what I had when I was like 10, and I’ve just kinda kept buying it.

Recently in a conversation with a friend, I was scratching my head and I mentioned how my head itched because I’d just washed my hair. They looked at me like I was nuts. I explained that my head always itches after I wash my hair, it’s a normal thing to happen and it means your head is clean, didn’t theirs itch too?

No, no it didn’t. And so, after a long conversation, it came forth the realization that I have been using the same shampoo for the last ~10 or so years. It never bugged me all that much and wasn’t a huge issue so I just figured my head itching was a natural side affect of washing my hair. It never occurred to me that, well, maybe it itches because I was ALLERGIC to the damn shampoo and conditioner I was using. 

So yeah. I’m going to buy new shampoo this week. And my friends are now deeply concerned for my sanity.

TL/DR; I didn’t realize that I was allergic to my shampoo, and continued to use it for the last ten years because I figured that my head itching was a natural affect of washing my hair.",786
"TIFU by almost touching an art piece by Giuseppe Arcimboldo, and sounding an alarm which called security",t2_17iiq0,"So this happened many years ago when I was still a kid, so i guess it wouldn’t be TIFU, but i would really like to get this story off of my chest. So i was in an art museum in France that was not the Louve ( sorry if i misspelled that), but it was still a pretty big art museum that had many famous collections, of which one of them was a room full of paintings by Giuseppe Arcimboldo (for those of you who don’t know he was the artist that made the paintings of people made of food and other random things). So let me start by saying that i had been walking all day and was therefore very tired, you know when your in a new city you wanna see everything so you decide to walk everywhere, so my back was absolutely killing me, but we were in a rush to see everything since the museum was closing soon so there wasn’t a chance for me to sit down. So there I was walking enjoying the paintings when i reached the room, or better say the hallway of where the said painting were kept
and decided to walk up to the painting to get a better look, so here is where the FU happens. I turned around to talk to my brother and decided to put my hand on the wall for a little bit of rest, however before i realized what i was doing my finger tip had already grazed the loose wall that holds up the painting ( for those of you who are confused, in this art museum they hung up the works on separate stands and surround them with cloth walls so that if anyone tried to touch them a sensor would go off once the cloth moved). So after barely grazing the cloth a super loud alarm goes off and I completely freaked out, and bolted out of the room as fast as I could without looking like i was running away from a crime scene, which a obviously was, and in the corner of my eyes i saw that there were cameras pointing directly at the art works. My mind went through a million thoughts, what if they dragged me out of the museum? There were cameras so they knew it was me, so here i was freaking out thinking the worse would happen to me, so to calm me down my aunt who was with us took us to the little cafe area that was in the middle of the museum to sit down and drink something, but just as i thought that maybe everything would be ok, a lady which looks like the manager of the museum comes in with what looks like security staff. Now here I really thought something would happen, but the woman just walked passed our table without even looking at me and we left a little bit later. Most likely the staff of the museum looked over the museum video tapes and saw that I had not actually touched any of the art pieces and only grazed the wall by accident and decided to not really do anything. Let me just say that I am never getting that close to valuable art pieces again in the future.

TL;DR I accidentally grazed the wall surrounding very valuable paintings and set off a very loud alarm which called security",5
"TIFU by making a lady at Walgreens think I'm being abused, or am an addict",t2_2al5amz4,"So backstory, I'm working (I'm in the VERY beginning) on my Masters of Nursing Science to become an NP, and my boyfriend is in PA school. I'm absolutely surrounded by medical people in every aspect of my life, and I sometimes forget the rest of the world doesnt operate in my bubble. 

Most people dont know this, but blood draws and starting IV lines are an art, not a science. So this means that practice practice practice is the most important thing. 

It's so easy to start a line on someone with body builder veins, that you could probably learn it from YouTube. But the reality is that most people dont have body builder veins. I, for instance, have itsy bitsy little shy veins that dont like to pop up with a tourniquet, and they also roll harder than a teenager at a rave. 

Thanks to Covid, all my classes are online, and I don't know about you all, but I don't think starting IVs can be learned/practiced online. I've never had the opportunity to start a line during my clinicals so far, and a pandemic fucked it all up, and my clinicals are online for now. 

But due to my lovely rolling veins, and my boyfriend having access to medical supplies, I decided to practice on friends and family... and myself. 

Well I fucking suck, and even though I always get a flash in the chamber and into the vein, I somehow always blow it when I do it on myself.

So I'm at Walgreens and I forget that massive bruises on the hands and wrists aren't normal to nonmedical people, and this lady asks me ""are you okay?"". I tried to explain how the bruises happened but I have social anxiety and made it sound even worse. I think she thought I was a heroine addict if I wasn't getting beat. She asked me if I'm safe and have friends and family I can call. The cashier and customers behind me were staring at me too, and I just crumbled embarrassingly and said I'm fine. I hate how I cant just act normal when strangers talk to me. My brain just shuts down. But she gave me a sad look and walked off. My cashier didnt even make eye contact with me. So great, I can never shop there again. 

So I guess.... just be patient with your nurses, especially the new ones. Because we've all had to get super inventive to learn how to be effective healthcare providers during a pandemic. 

Remember to wear a mask and stay safe :)

TL:DR a lady at Walgreens thought my bruises were either abuse or drug use. I'm a struggling nursing student trying to deal with learning during a pandemic",22
TIFU by making my neighbors think I was abusing my findom client,t2_7xbsqdog,"So one of my oldest findom clients does housework for me like cleaning and cooking and laundry and stuff like that. It’s a great perk of having a sub but ended up with me nearly getting arrested. 

So this client is one I’ve had for a while so I trust him to come to my house and do the housework but I didn’t want him to sleep in the house with me if I needed him to stay over so he usually just sleeps outside. 

This had worked fine for the last few months and my old neighbors knew about my work so they were fine with it but recently an older couple moved in and I didn’t get the chance to meet them and explain my situation. 

So last night I needed my sub to stay over so he slept out in my driveway (his choice) and my neighbors had seen him sleeping outside as they came home and saw him again in the morning. They’d seen him around my house often and had assumed that he was my boyfriend and that I was abusing him by making him sleep outside in the cold. So I woke up this morning to cops pounding on my door and my client desperately trying to explain what was happening. I had to show the cops our agreement but they were still cautious about it and warned us against it.

I was waiting in line for the tickets and was fidgeting with my phone in my pocket. now know that I have a low-quality android and this doesn't stop your music when you unplug your headphones. I also listen to high volume since I had shitty headphones. 

Here's where I fuck up:  


I unplug my headphones, and then the girl says ""YOU GOT A CONDOM??"" my face was beet red s everyone in a 10-foot radius heard and looked at me. They were thinking that a 14-year-old really listen to that trash. Now, Logic is a great rapper but that one part makes people turn their heads

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I blast accidentally a some vulgar words from a rap song when unplugging my heaphones",8
Tifu by showing my balls to a girl on omegle,t2_610ik5ed,"So this happened today in the evening . I was just using Omegle for some kind of timepass but eventually I forgot about it . It was just swapped out from my mind that I was using Omegle , that too on video call . They were going from one girl to another and I was lying naked on my bed just relaxing for a bit(I still forgot that Omegle webcam was on) . But then , after just a few seconds , I just looked downwards and what the fuckk !!!! There was an African girl who was texting me hi and hello and on my webcam I could see my balls and dick in low angle view . She was just laughing (yes seriously...!!!). But after seeing that , my throat went sore , my heartbeat gone crazy , my brain felt ice cold and I was really fucked up for some few seconds or so. But out of that tension and perplexed mood I quickly turned the cam of . It was really good that I had long hair so my face was half covered and she was unable to see me . But I really felt very bad and sorry for her , as she maybe wanted to chat but I ended up showing her my balls . FML .

TL DR : was unaware of Omegle webcam turned on while I was naked on my bed and ended up showing my balls and dick to a girl . But thankfully , she was unable to see my face cuz of my long hair jumped forward while I was closing the cam 😂 .",0
TIFU by sleeping before a zoom meeting,t2_4ddp8d4k,"So, as you all know, many of us have had to resort to the most terrible way of doing school ever, online school. Now, it may not be bad for everyone, but for me (15F) it sure is terrible. It drains me, keeps me up all night doing homework (which makes no sense because we are already at home, duh XD), and makes me just want to close my computer and sleep forever. Which leads me to my story! 

So, after the most restful 3 week winter break ever, I dreadfully logged onto my online school today. My first class was pretty easy, it’s called “Human Growth and Development”. This class wasn’t terrible, as she just let us talk about our winter breaks and we only had to do one easy assignment. Next, I had Language Arts, which again, was honestly pretty easy because we were just taking notes. 

But, after that class was my 1 hour break. So, i decided to take a nap and set my alarm to wake up when I needed to get online again. (Bad idea). Well, knowing me, I SLEPT THROUGH THE ALARM and missed science class and half of geometry. Honestly, I hate these 2 classes. But I am known to be a pretty good student, and sleeping through online class is not something I have ever done before. Thankfully, I logged onto geometry halfway into the class. 


The even worse part is I had a dream of meeting my favorite celebrities. So, while skipping class, I had an amazing dream that wasn’t even real. Good going on my part smh. I hope that is the last time I ever sleep through class, and I still feel terrible about it, but I mean everyone makes mistakes and that was just probably one of the smaller mistakes of this world. Anyways, if you have gotten this far, thank you for reading and I hope you are having a lovely day :)


TL;DR - fell asleep before I logged onto science which is not normal for me, and even had an awesome dream which made me feel very confused and upset when i woke up.",19
TIFU by eating a bowl of interesting porridge oats,t2_oe83s,"Recently moved house and had both a sealed container of porridge and the last of the bag of oats I figured I'd use up the bag to get rid of the packing.

Poured the rest of the bag in to the bowl, added milk, added golden syrup, zapped it in the microwave and done, sat down to eat. Tasted a little weird and....crunchy.  Wife walked in to the kitchen as I was trying to figure out why it didn't taste quite right and thought it must be because of the dreggs of the pack (last bits), she took on look at the empty paper bag of oats and instantly creased up and had the worst look on her face.

I ate a bowl of weevils, a few oats and a bit of syrup, I am mortified, basically did my own bush trial eating bugs. 

Absolutely devastated hahaha

Note - the bag wasn't even that old figure it's because it was in storage whilst we were moving house.


tldr, wanted breakfast, made porridge ate (alot of) weevils thinking I was using up the last of the pack",14
TIFU by Watching Porn: when I should have been sexting my bf,t2_7nih7wrs,"
Disclaimer: new to reddit, please excuse formatting and other newbie mistakes.

I (20F) and my bf(21M) had just spent the evening getting dinner and having a wonderful night together. Went for food, went shopping, played a game together, all that jazz.  Usually we like to get a little bit physical, but there were other people in the house so obviously that was off the table. Before he went home he mentioned us sending some risky things later that night when he got home. 

Now before I get to that, let me reiterate the statement that I am new to reddit and the world of amazing things in this app. Recently, I discovered that they have whole ACCOUNTS dedicated to NSFW stuff- fascinating!! I have never in my life watched porn, (something super intimidating about pornhub) so I was a little bit weirded out, yet I decided to explore and marvel at the fact that people post that kind of stuff on here. Anyway, my bf and I are very open with each other: I tell him everything. So earlier in the evening I casually mentioned me finding some interesting stuff on reddit, and he began to ask what kind, what I found, what subreddits, etc.... he got kind of excited because he knew that porn was very new to me and was intrigued at me exploring. That made me feel pretty good! Anyways that was pretty much the end of our convo about it. That is, until he got home.

We started to text and he asked me more about my reddit discoveries (getting on the sexy topics- yall know how it goes), and I perhaps foolishly? Told him what I had been looking at, and we talked about me finding something a little more my speed being new to porn- all the crazy stuff was a little much for me. I was then on the hunt for something a little more vanilla. So I started to look at just pictures, and then just dick pics. He seemed interested yet mentioned about being a little insecure, but we joked about some funny weird stuff that I found on there. He then started sending me pics of himself- which of course I loved, but I thought we were still on the reddit topic, so i continued my search to find my niche that I thought he wanted me to find. 

Well my stupid brain of mine was so distracted in trying to accomplish the goal of finding stuff, that I completely negated the fact that he wanted virtual sexy time with me. So a few of his pics later, he asked me why I was taking so long to respond, to which I said something to the effect of “on reddit looking at dicks that aren’t yours”...... not such a great look huh?

He then got very quiet and very upset- to which I completely understand. I immediately realized that I had fucked up... big time. All because I thought HE thought it was hot that I was watching porn. *facepalm*... because it TOTALLY makes sense to basically ignore your SO’s pics to look at other’s pics so that your SO will think that’s hot.... like what????? So here I was, with a now SUPER insecure boyfriend, a reddit search history no one could be proud of,  and my incredible ability to create this situation itself. I swear I really am so stupid sometimes. In the moment I really thought “oh yea he’s gonna love that I’m doing this” and MEANWHILE I’m ignoring HIS pictures?!!!!! Oh my god I could die right now. How could I be so ignorant? All because I was trying to do something I thought he would like. Clearly I need to re-evaluate my life choices when it comes to this stuff. I’ve stayed away from porn my whole life- and I’m starting to think that it was all for a reason.

Thanks for reading and please be nice in the comments:)

Oh and PS: my bf and I talked it all out and it is now a joke between us. I pull stupid and idiotic stuff between us a lot and this is one big old cannonball in his arsenal of my situational belly flops. I am so lucky to have him and that he was able to see my ignorance and realize that it was all just a misunderstanding and not something more. I think I took the whole ordeal harder than he did lol!


Edit: since I’m new to reddit I didn’t really understand what the TL:DR was for, or what to put for it. Let me rewrite it.

TL;DR:  My new discovery of Reddit Porn led to me ignoring my boyfriends sexts. When he asked what was up I said something along the lines of “looking at dicks that aren’t yours”",125
TIFU by watching my car roll backwards down the driveway on it's way to the corner light pole and fire hydrant.,t2_7hm7xjur,"This happened a few years ago.

I had returned home with my dog after an outing and pulled into the garage.  I disconnected him from his safety harness and connected him to the leash.  As we walked up the stairs to the door I hit the button to close the garage door. I hear the door starting to close and then immediately retract.  I stand there for a few milliseconds thinking something is breaking the beam and preventing an accidental closure.  I turn around to look back to discover that what is breaking the beam is my car rolling out of the garage down the driveway because I forgot to pull the parking brake (I had a manual transmission at the time).  My dog can be a runaway so I'm standing there thinking ""Do I run with the dog to the car or drop the leash or...""  Finally, I drop the leash and thankfully was able to jump into the car and pull the brake before it entered the corner intersection and crashed into the light pole or a nearby fire hydrant.  Then in a panic, jumped out of the car to grab the dog and into the house.  After I get the car secured in the garage, I make a trip straight to the liquor cabinet to down some Irish whisky. The next car was an automatic.

TL;DR Forgot to set the parking brake on my manual transmission vehicle and had to sprint to catch it before it crashed into city utility structures.",3
Tifu by trying to get rid of an erection,t2_8wybtl5r,"
Today I had morning wood. In order to save myself the embarrassment of leaving my room with an erection, I pulled up a gay porn video on my computer because that was the only surefire way to get rid of it. Unfortunately, I spent so much time worrying about leaving my room with an erection that I completely forgot to lock my door, and my mom walked in on me watching gay porn while I held my erect penis (in order to feel the erection diminish in real time). Now, not only has my mom seen my erect penis, she also thinks I’m gay and no matter how many times I tell her the real reason I was watching gay porn she refuses to believe me. 

TL;DR I watched gay porn to get rid of my erection and now my mom thinks I'm gay when literally the opposite is true.",0
TIFU by not doing my covid test.,t2_y2zjw,"I had an appointment made at around noon today to make the test and have the results by tomorrow. Why? Because I travel for work and I need to present the negative result to the city I stay at. It's the law. 

Half hour after I was supposed to be there at the lab, I get a message from one of my superiors saying that the nurse called him and said I didn't show up. It dawned on me. I completely f*cking forgot it! I never missed one and I travel back and forth weekly.

In a rush, I make several phonecalls, one to the lab, my gf, the responsible person at the project, etc. I will miss one day of work but they said it was ok. Nevertheless, I feel terrible I depressed I missed the test. I guess my mind is still on vacation mode. 

TLDR: forgot covid test today, can't travel tomorrow for work. Will miss one day of work.",36
TIFU by getting a first-hand experience of what Period Stained Clothes feel like,t2_3qqhbotv,"Obligatory, not today. This happened in school. I was a shy kid back in school. And one day I had new pair of pants for my school uniform. It was normal day in school, hours went by sitting in the class and it was break time. I went out of my class like a loner with my hands in my pocket lol, and that's when I saw my crush. 

The moment she saw me, she had the O_O face. I think this is the first time she even noticed me. I waved my hand to say Hi, and she waved back and left creeped out. I had zero social interactions at that point in time so I couldn't make out anything from it.

 Until I saw the hand which was still mid air. Drenched in blue. I screamed as I did not understand what was happening. I checked my pants and the floor and realised that I kept a pen in my pocket without the cap and it leaked. Oh it leaked. It was on the pant, my hands, the floor, and hearing the scream everyone nearby around my noticed it. That memory has given me massive amount of respect for women ever since xD

Tl;dr kept a pen in my pockets without cap, and pretty much had blue periods.",10
TIFU by texting a guy,t2_5jkp4ow1,"Few weeks back, I had been chatting with a guy on a dating app. The conversation was interesting enough to suggest texting to set up a time we could meet. He sent me his number. 
Around 9pm I texted, what I thought, was his number. I couldn't copy and paste from the app because it would copy the entire message not just the number. So I  clicked on the conversation in the app...went to my texts, started a new convo and entered the number. I have a bad memory, as we'll see.

I went to bed around 10 pm. Around 10:30 I get a call from an unknown number...I ignore it. But then I see I had missed a call from this number a few minutes before. Phone starts ringing again and I answer it thinking something must be wrong.
It's a girl and she says ""Is this kelly?"" No....she hangs up.
She calls back and asks who I am. I'm super confused and she says her boyfriend got a text from my number and who the hell am I. I look at my texts and sure enough, it's the number she's calling from. Problem is the last digit isn't the right number to the guy I tried to text.
Now I'm realizing she saw a text from a number on her boyfriends phone that's says ""Do you want to the and get together?""
I'm sure her mind is jumping to the conclusion that he's fucking around behind her back.

I started apologizing profusely,  I assured her I did not know her boyfriend,  I meant to send that to someone else,  I tried to stick up for this poor guy who didn't ask for this drama, I told her not to blame him, and I was really sorry for my error. I don't know who kelly is, maybe some girl she was suspicious of and she wanted to try and catch him.
Went to bed hoping I hadn't split up a happy couple by making her think he was cheating. 

TL;DR Sent a text to the wrong guy resulting in angry phone call from his girlfriend",28
TIFU By spending 40 bucks on a Starbucks Frappuccino,t2_4k2imony,"So today I went to get my flu vaccine(FINALLY) which was a 15 minute drive(I ubered) and since I hadn’t done any exercise I thought “I’ll just walk  back till I get tired then uber home from where I am.” I also had 10% on my phone so I just walked in the direction I thought was right cuz I didn’t want to use maps and then not be able to use Uber. I walked for about an hour, which was actually nice without my phone, just me and the outside and soon I made it to where I knew I was. At that point I was confident I could make it home without collapsing but I was also hungry and I wanted to sit down at a Starbucks and relax with my phone. The problem was I didn’t have a charger and my phone was now at 4% so I could either continue till I got home and eat something there or I could buy a charger, which I was pretty sure I needed a spare, then charge my phone at Starbucks while on it. I decided to go with the second choice. I get the charger which was 35 bucks and then I reach the Starbucks and remember there’s a fucking pandemic so no seating. As I was already there and I was still hungry I bought myself a frappuccino and drank it on the walk back home. This would’ve been bad enough but I discovered to my annoyance that I already had a spare at home which meant I had bought a charger for absolutely no reason at all.

TLDR: I buy a spare charger so I can get a drink at Starbucks and charge my phone there but because of COVID there’s no seating and I find out I already have a spare at home",0
Tifu by sending memes,t2_40qdvlgh,So I enjoy dark humor like really dark shit and I sent a  video of a raccoon getting crushed by a shiping container then the guardians of the galaxy intro plays and i laughed at it and sent it to my friend he then said he was already on edge with me this month and said I question our friendship and next time you send me shit like this I'll never talk to you again. I did say I was truly sorry and didn't think he would get mad at it but now i just feel like the biggest piece of shit ever and dont know what to do. Is there anything you guys would suggest that I should do? I'm just  completely hurt at the moment and just can't seem to think of any other way to apologize.  (sorry for anyone who doesn't like dark humor i just thought it was funny......),0
TIFU by getting into an accident in a work vehicle for my brand new job.,t2_1ri9dxdi,"I recently started a brand new job in a field that I never ever thought I would go into. It’s hard work but pays very well and there are tons of perks like a company truck, phone, etc. The only bad part about it is how terrible I am. I’ve only been there a month and training is a lot of me figuring it out on my own which always leads to me screwing something up. Mind you this is not my dream job, just something to pay the bills for now.

Well, I was driving to work this morning and got off on the exit where our office is located. I let the truck in front of me go forward, look both ways, press on the gas and BAM. I slam into the back of this guys new 2021 Toyota Tundra. We pull off on the the side in a motel parking lot and I call my managers (who think I’m dumb as shit already) and proceed to tell them how I hit someone with a company vehicle. To make matters worse, as we’re waiting on the cop, the other driver comes out and tells me that he had bought the vehicle yesterday and it had less than 100 miles on it. 

When I get to the office, I arrive to a bunch of shaking heads and sucking teeth which, at this point I’m used to. There was undoubtedly a ton of paper work and even more guilt. 

TL;DR I suck at my new job, everyone thinks I’m stupid and I fuel that perception by hitting someone with a company vehicle",12
TIFU by burning down my house to watch a movie,t2_3dniqm5a,"This was the year Avatar came out to theaters so it was a while back

Anyways, I was living with my parents in a small 2 room apartment when my mom wanted to go watch Avatar as she saw posts about it on the media. It was dinner time, so she had something on the stove while discussing going to the theater. My dad agreed and being a pre teen was pretty excited to go to the theater to watch the latest hot movie that was trending. So, we left around 20 min later forgetting that the stove was left on. (We were going to get snacks at the movie theater). We watched the movie and we returned back into the apartment to find no door and inside the apartment completely burned to black. Thankfully, the building was built to contain the fire with sprinklers and so on so we didn't cause too much damage outside my own apartment. The firefighters did their job and they left a note on the outside saying ""Kall me"" with a K not a C so that was pretty funny.

TL:DR I went to go watch avatar while the stove was on leading to my apartment to be destroyed",7
TIFU by not showering with my best friend,no author,"Obligatory ""not today"" this happened 9 years ago but I only realised today it was a fuck up

I (27F) was talking to my husband (28M) about the differences between girl friendships and boy friendships. Mainly we were discussing that girls are generally more physically affectionate with each other than boys are.

I decided to bring up an example about the best friend I had when I was 16 until 20: We would spoon watching films, hold hands, cuddle asleep during sleepovers etc. Then I mentioned we would practise kissing each other so we'd be experts whenever we kissed boys.

At this point my husband stopped me to say that that's not friendly affection. It's worth pointing out that I am bisexual so for some reason I somehow assumed he was saying I couldn't have been affectionate with my friend because of this. 

I began defending it ""No no it wasn't like that!"" and then went on to prove it by saying ""We even used to take turns showering together and the other would just chill in the bathroom chatting with us."" He was baffled by this and asked why. I didnt really have an answer other than whenever I was at her house, and we had the place to ourselves, she'd always want to try a new face mask or hair dye/product and while we initially would take turns showering she suggested we both just stay in the room to keep each other company. 

**ETA: I swear thought I'd mentioned this but apparently not! When she suggested the shower thing she initially said we should shower together to save water and time since we could help wash each others hair etc. I'd panicked and kind of babbled excuses about ""oh we wouldn't both fit and it would be just as quick to wait for the other to finish"" hence why we ended up sitting in the bathroom while the other showered then swapping**

I then pointed out she knew I was bi and I'd never wanted her to feel uncomfortable so I'd always made sure when she was showering to look away and if she asked me to look over for any reason I would completely maintain eye contact the entire time. Which to me proved it was nothing romantic at all!

I pointed out how difficult I found the entire experience because I'd had a massive crush on her and she'd always made jokes about how we didnt need boys because we had each other/ she wished we could just live together and make out all the time which just made the crush worse!

ANYWAY after some back and forth with my husband (who at this point was crying with laughter after I'd explained how hard it was to maintain the eye contact since often she'd ask me to look at stretch marks/freckles/ends of her hair) he finally got me to realise she was very likely trying to sleep with me and I'd been so worried about revealing my crush and ruining our friendship I hadnt noticed! 

TLDR was so scared of friend finding out about my crush I didnt realise she may have been trying to seduce me",39611
TIFU getting the longest line for drivethru covid testing while suffering from stomach issues,t2_8jcnqvt5,"Too late to back out now. Covid testing at a big rec center lot, need to be tested to return to work. Tried to do this last week before the holiday and was turned away because the lot was full. So today I showed up 45min early, full tank of gas, assuming for some turnout- it is pure insanity. Longest line of cars I've ever seen. Looks like I'm trying to enter a festival.

The way we're positioned in line prevents me from backing out and leaving. There's no way to even have others back up and let me out because were too close to each other and snowbanks have made the area too narrow for a 3 point turn. No bathroom/portable toilet in sight. I'm starting to get the urge to pee as well. I can't figure out a creative way to get out of this. Will post updates in the comments section.

Tl;dr - went to get tested for covid and got stuck in a drivethru line I can't get out of with diarrhea.

Remember me the way I was..",12
TIFU by forgetting the Mail adress I bought Bitcoin with,t2_2ikhpnz8,"So  in 2018 smartass me bought some bitcoin when it was pretty low. Because  I am so super smart, I decided it was time to get a proper mail adress  from a nice provider. I remember I checked Bitcoin a lot for some  months, watching it go up and down but eventually I lost interest and  didn't log into my Coinbase account for more than a year.

Fast  forward to now, Bitcoin is exploding and I now try to figure out the  mail adress I created solely for this purpose and I can not even  remember the provider from the mail. So now I am sitting here, writing  to random mail providers asking them if they can search up some words  that could maybe be in my adress.. I know that I wrote the login data  somewhere, so simultanously I am tearing apart my flat trying to find  that small piece of paper.

I feel very stupid.

TL;DR Bought Bitcoin in 2018, forgott Login data, probably lost money as Bitcoin is exploding.",6
"TIFU by saying ""hey look it's your boyfriend!""",t2_8m0r3ys4,"This happened today and I'm now facepalming at the comment i made about my friend. 

Little bit of context: im living with my girlfriend's parent's and have been since everything started with the world circumstances and a different topic not for this sub. 

So my best friend let's call him R (16M) came out to me as bi romantic (for those of you who don't know it's romantic attraction to both genders) and im proud of him for coming out to me and my girlfriend K! (15F) Of course we supported him 


While we were supporting him and he and i (16F) were having a conversation with his girlfriend M (17F) and he seemed to calm down a bit until the dumbass inside of me decided to pull his strings a bit here comes the FU. 

So the 4 of us were having a conversation which eventually lead to video call (something we do fairly often and we love it) 

K was watching dragon ball super which was an interest both of them shared and a scene came up where Android 17 came up (his favorite character) and i proudly yelled ""hey R look it's your boyfriend!"" while pointing the camera at the TV while laughing my ass off after.

R quickly excused himself and turned off his camera and i later found out that his notifications were probably turned off considering he wasn't texting K and hasn't spoken since. 

M and K told me that my joke really wasn't funny and ""he's still very embarrassed you should be more considerate"" and proceeded with about a 20 minute lecture but K wasn't mad M however...Just a little bit 

Tl;Dr made a joke about my friend being Bi turned his face into a cherry and got a lecture",0
TIFU making use of my video editing skills to satisfy my horny side,t2_44r2fr5u,"Okay so it was new year and we went to my house to celebrate. All was good, got my room renovated, nothing could go wrong for 2021 right?

Anyway it was already 2 am and everyones already sleeping while i am alone in my room, it wouldnt hurt to beat my dick off to some really good hentai that i was specifically saving for this very event but unfortunately, there was no internet. Luckily i had this app with videos and files i downloaded from the internet so surely there must be some leftover porn in it. I found this one video of a woman just showing her ass and teasing the viewers (if thats the term for it). I completely forgot about that video before so it felt like seeing it like its my first time. Holy shit it was really fucking hot dude like there was no music so you can hear her moaning, breathing n shi, it felt like she was close to me (god im lonely). Suddenly there was this part where she slaps her ass, i suddenly got a really weird feeling and got really fucking horny but i wanna make it hotter because its new year so it needs to be special. I went to this video editing app, literally edited parts of the video to be louder, repeated, zoomed in, all that shit because i was literally that horny and desperate. Theres a problem tho, i cant go out or they might find out, the only lube is the backup menthol shampoo in my cabinet, it will give a spicy sensation but i had to risk it.

Yeah that wasnt a good idea, i watched like the entire video while doing a literally doing a bop-it combo attack on my dick, it felt refreshing during the moment until i fucking came dude. Legit it felt like fire needle porcupines are going in and out of my dick at the same time and leaving splinters afterwards. I had menthol shampoo as lube a few times before, i could handle it but the problem is that it was a special day. I was doing it for like a long time nonstop with combos and i was watching a really cute video made hotter with my editing which means it was extra painful and i fucking came for around 10 seconds. IT WAS LIKE 10 SECONDS OF GIVING BIRTH THROUGH MY DICK!!1! anyways i drank alot of water for refreshment but i was stupid, i had to pee which means i gotta go through that pain again. That went on for like 3 hours but it was slowly fading.

TL;DR i used my video editing skills to make the porn vid i watched hotter and used menthol shampoo causing me to feel pain as if i was giving birth even though im a guy.",9
TIFU by not turning on a light while making a sandwich,t2_tahux,"So, this literally happened about 40 minutes ago. I went upstairs to the kitchen to grab some food, but it was 12:30 am my time and other people are in the house, so I didn't really want to turn on a light (even though no one would have seen it, but whatever). I decided to heat up some pulled pork leftovers from yesterday, and while it was heating up I went to the dark pantry and grabbed some bread. I pulled the meat out of the microwave, made a few sandwiches and went ahead and ate one of them while watching a YouTube video. Then I picked up my phone to make a comment on Reddit and accidentally flashed it onto my plate and saw a horrifying sight-the bread was green. I accidentally found some super old bread in the pantry, and since I hadn't turned a light on, I hadn't even realized anything was wrong with this bread. I only noticed this after eating an ENTIRE sandwich on that bread. I immediately threw the other two sandwiches away and went to the sink, and very nearly vomited. I have no clue how dangerous eating that much moldy bread is, but it was sure as hell extremely gross, and I'm suddenly not very hungry anymore.

TL;DR-I made some sandwiches without turning a light on in the kitchen, ate one, then noticed that the bread was covered in mold.",47
TIFU by buying an f/4 camera lens as a brit,t2_zae76,"To preface i'm a photographer who mostly uses a small pocket camera (Sony RX100) and a DSLR only for bigger jobs, i'm not a big fan of mirrorless.

Anyway, i was getting bored of using my RX100 and missed the large viewfinders, the battery life, and everything else that came with DSLR's, but my only DSLR was a Canon 1D IV which is way too big and heavy to carry around.

So my christmas gift to myself was the Canon 7D w/ EF 24-105 f/4L

I was a little skeptical of getting a lens with a maximum aperture of 4, my sony is 1.8, if you don't know what that means, f = l / D where l = focal length of lens and d = diameter of the front element of the lens, the lower the number, the more light the lens lets in.

But i realized i never really used f/1.8 on my RX100 unless it's really dark, i'm a pixel peeper with self-diagnosed OCD and the zeiss lens at 1.8 is a little soft, so i mostly used f/4-8.

So i opened the lens and camera on christmas day, the lens had some scuffs which knocked it down in value, the camera, some signs of use but very well looked after with low shutter count, both are fantastic.

The problem? I've been bringing the camera/lens out on essential days, but literally everyday it's been overcast and raining, and i'm forced to use a max aperture of f/4, the pictures either come out grainy due to high ISO or blurry, or underexposed, and i'm pretty sure i have some form of Seasonal affective disorder, which means i have no inspiration and have taken a few hundred photos, only a handful have actually been decent enough for my portfolio, the rest is blurry or just me testing it out.

I also overestimated the High ISO noise performance, my RX100 deals with noise fantastically and even then it's only nice monochromatic and there's still info in the shadows, the canon though, has horid chromatic noise, hot pixels and no info in the shadows.

On a bright sunny day it's a great combo, if i was one of those stereotypes living on the West Coast of the USA in Sunny CA, i'm sure i'd be getting some great pictures of my VW camper and the palm trees at the beach while cranking the vibrance up high for those cyan blue skies at shutter speeds of 1/2000 at f/8 with ISO 200.

But no, i'm a brit with typical british weather trying to get atleast a decent macro shot of a raindrop on a window at 1/30 of a second at ISO 12,800 hoping f/4 is good enough.

To make matters worse i bought myself a cheap ND filter set because i envisioned doing photography on a sunny day, they haven't seen a single bit of use yet.

I'm considering getting an EF 50mm f/1.8 STM 

TL;DR: I'm a photographer who was bored of shooting with a pocket camera so i bought a decent used DSLR and F/4 lens as my christmas gift, only to find out it doesn't let in enough light for overcast rainy british days, i have barely used it, and i'm considering buying a nifty fifty 1.8 or going back to using my pocket camera",2
Tifu by asking a coworker for help with spanish when neither us speak spanish.,t2_3q5ipqh9,"I work in an IT repair center and we repair computers from all over the US. Since the US has no official laungauge we get a lot of computers in different laungages, today I got that was in spanish. I know enough spanish to start a conversation but not keep one going, so I used what little spanish I know to get most of the job done. The problem I ran into was with the antivirus. It was blocking my program from running, so I went to my coworker and asked him to turn the anti virus off as it was in spanish and I couldn't read it. He looks at and says "" u don't know what any of this says, this is in spanish""I replied ""oh I'm sorry, I thought you spoke spanish"" embarrassing for both of us I took the walk of shame to the guy less than five feet behind him and asked him since I was directed to him. He did know spanish and was able to help.

TIFU by leaving my dorm room door open while having my boyfriend over,t2_7af52l6f,"Today I fucked up by having my boyfriend over to my dorm room and forgetting to close the door fully. We didn't even have sex but people are going to think we did. We did however make out and talk about some potentially cringe-worthy stuff.

God. Oh God. I don't even know why I have so much anxiety about this. It sounds like a funny story. But I'm literally considering moving (but I can't). It's night now but I know I'll have to face my corridor-mates, all 10 of them, (who I don't know well enough for it not to be awkward) in the kitchen tomorrow.

I don't know what I'm going to do. I think one of the topics we talked about was my breasts. If they heard that I'm dead. So absolutely dead with shame. I've literally become Easy A. I need to move.

Sorry if this was rant-y but I had to rant to alleviate my anxiety. Please post something nice, I need it.

TL;DR: I forgot to close my dorm room door while my boyfriend was there making out and talking about cringy stuff. There are 10 other people in my corridor who might've heard.",3
TIFU by accidentally mailing Porn to my parents for Christmas,t2_rhgvoj4,"Obviously this happened over Christmas, but I just learned the extent of my mistake today so here I am.

My mom (Mother) and my dad (Father) raised me and my siblings in a pretty religious household. We went to church everyday and comparatively had a strict upbringing. However, as part of that up bringing Mother never wanted sex or sexuality to be this weird, mysterious thing. So she always went out of her way to educate us and make sure that we understood what sex was, the pros and cons, and all of that. So while we were a religious family, sex was not a terribly taboo subject.

As such sex was often something we would talk about and joke about, especially as we started getting older and married. That is the set up for my mistake.

A few weeks ago I called Mother and asked what she wanted for Christmas, historically I would give my parents a bunch of gift cards to various restaurants, but money is a bit tighter this year so I couldn't provide my usual gifts. When I asked her what she wanted it was ""Just a simple gift ward would be lovely, or a book that Father and I could read together.""

So I sent them a little gift card to Texas Road house and a book: [365 Sex Positions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1646040333/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). I thought it was funny. My package came with a little note of ""Date night is one me. One gift is for Father one is for Mother. I'll let you decide which is which""

Ha. I'm hilarious.

They opened it Christmas year in front of my two siblings who were still at home and I got all the reactions I wanted (supposedly, I was at the in-laws this Christmas). 

Well, on a call today with Mother, she told me that the book I had sent her was *graphic*. Like live models posing the positions and close camera shots graphic. See I was thinking it would be outlines or drawings, not Paul and Amy getting freaky in the sheets.

So I sent my \~60 year old, religious mother a book of 365 graphic sex photos. I'm not sure if that counts as pornography in most households but it certainly does in mine. Whoops.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr -- Sent my religious mother a book of 365 sex positions with very graphic photos.",62
TIFU by going to the bathroom at work,t2_8nqhm8a5,"This afternoon I was at work (restaurant job) when I had the sudden urge to go #2. I had a waitress watch my tables and proceeded to go to the bathroom.

While I was sitting on the john scrolling reddit and taking care of business, the toilet flushed underneath me by itself (it’s motion-sensored). Some water splashed up at me which was disgusting, so I lifted up and let it flush. Again, the same thing happened a minute later. After that flush, it flushed two more times consecutively. I lifted my body up to see what was going on, and found that the toilet was clogged and filled to the BRIM OF THE SEAT. 

I freaked out and stood up, and from there it flushed again causing my business to flow out of it and all over the floor. There was a man outside of the stall at the urinal (right next to it) and he let out a “HEY” and went to the sink to wash his hands and leave. From there I scrambled to grab my shit (no pun intended) and got the hell out of there. 

I was pretty embarrassed when I left the bathroom and didn’t tell anyone. One of the line cooks walked in and yelled “WHAT THE FUCK?” and a manager was notified. I don’t think anybody knew it was me but the waitress that I asked to watch my tables gave me a strange look so there’s that. 

Tl;dr -

I took care of business on a motion-sensored toilet and clogged it, causing it to malfunction and flood the bathroom.",99
TIFU by letting a jackal sleep in my bed,t2_7tp940k0,"So, yesterday morning, I went camping with my sister and our cousin. It was to a remote little cabin that the cousin's godfather owns, which mostly goes unused. Now, it's pretty far off from civilization - as in, an ideal spot to shoot a horror movie. The nights there are pitch-black, and you could quite literally die by just walking around after the sun sets.

Well, in the middle of the night, I heard scratching a the door, and went to check it out. For the record, we have no dangerous animals there. No wolves, bears or lynxes in the area, though they do exist in the country. The most you'll see is a deer or a fox. Even the boars live much further north.

So when I open the door, I see a cute little brown puppy there. It was really shy, but I managed to goad it into coming inside. I fed it, gave it some water, then took it to bed with me.

Woke up to my cousin screaming in the morning, outside. My sister and I immediately rushed to see what it is (the puppy was already awake, sitting at the foot of my bed). When we got outside, we saw seven jackals peeking at my cousin from the forest. As we were leaving the cabin, the puppy ran with us, and straight toward the jackals. Then they vanished, and my cousin and sister turned to me to ask wtf I thought I was doing.

Apparently, jackals don't live only in Africa. You learn something new every day. I deadass did not think they existed in Europe, let alone all the way in Croatia.

TLDR: Let a jackal pup into a cabin, and its pack was waiting for it outside, nearly giving my cousin a heart attack.",14354
TIFU by accidentally spilling a chocolate milk drink on a kid at my high school and running away,t2_1kq24cmx,"Clarification: this happened six years ago when I was still in high school. It was a time where I was a loner and I always ate alone in the school cafeteria. The lunch break of my school lasted for an hour. Back then, I also had a busted watch and to make things worse phones weren’t allowed in my school.  

I did my routine of eating lunch and studying at the same time. As I wasn’t keeping track of time, I didn’t realize that 50 minutes had passed and I only found out when i asked a nearby acquaintance what time it was. I panicked as I had a test which was scheduled to happen after lunch. On my way back to the classroom, I decided to buy a chocolate milk drink and to quench my thirst. After I paid for it, I realized that I had less than 5 minutes. I panicked and ended up spilling the drink on a grade schooler who was walking by. My school had a high school and grade school. Their lunch time tended to start as our lunch time ended.

As I felt the drink leave the cup, I looked and saw that the grade schooler’s white polo shirt was now brown from the drink. I was so embarrassed that I ran away. Unfortunately, the kid wasn’t given an apology which I still regret. On the other hand, I got back to the classroom in the nick of time and took the test 

TLDR: I spilled a drink on a grade schooler by accident due to panic as I had a test after lunch and I wasted my time.",9
TIFU by not checking the name on my package,t2_9hy8ypet,"So my wife and I recently decided to try a few new things to spice up our intimacy during COVID. I don't often buy lingerie for her, but when I do I usually get it from victoria's secret or a place that's near our house. Because of covid, I decided to try buying her a few items from Amazon instead. I went kind of crazy and purchased about 6 pieces of lingerie, a very realistic dildo, and a butt plug - I was ready for a great weekend.

I was sitting at my home office a few days later and got a notification that the delivery was a few stops away. It was pouring and I didn't want the package to get soaked, so I went to the door and greeted the delivery guy as he fumbled around a bunch of packages and handed me mine. I set the package on the table to dry while I finished up my work and few minutes later I got the a gut twisting text...

""Hey!  We're expecting a bunch of deliveries from Amazon today and accidentally opened one of yours that was accidentally delivered to us.  Sorry!""

I read this text that was between me, my wife, my neighbor, and his mother, and felt my heart drop. I quickly went to amazon to see if it could have possibly been a different package that was delivered to my neighbor, but no, the most intimate, private package that I have ever had sent to me was delivered to the wrong address...and of course, it was opened. It was the perfect storm.

I then went to check the package that I set on the table and realized that sure enough, it was addressed to my neighbor. Had I noticed this when the package was delivered, you wouldn't be reading this story. In an attempt to comfort myself, I thought ""well, maybe the lingerie inside the package just looks like clothes""...I had to do the awkward exchange to find out.

I dropped the package on my neighbors porch and responded to his text to let him know about the mix-up and he brought mine over shortly after. Luckily it was still raining, so there was a good excuse to not share any dialog other than ""sorry about that!"" I brought the package into the house and set the box on the dining room table and opened up the two flaps that had obviously been previously opened. The first thing I see is a massive penis looking dildo in a clear hard plastic tube. Right next to it, the stacked lingerie with a label on the top that read ""Schoolgirl lingerie set"". The butt plug was nestled in the corner, but it was easy enough to see.

Anyways, my neighbor and I have not spoken about this awkward occurrence, and I certainly don't plan to. Word of advice, if you ever buy lingerie or anything else that is private online, make sure the delivery driver delivers it to the right house if it's at all possible. Also, check your packages and make sure they're delivered to you!

TL;DR - Bought a bunch of sex stuff online, it got delivered to my neighbor by accident, and my neighbor opened it up and obviously saw inside my sick kinky mind.",1
TIFU by getting caught with weed,t2_1zss0rci,"I am 18 and still live with my parents. I should be at University, but due to covid, I was not able to make in on campus. For the past year or so I have been smoking weed, but hiding it from my asian parents. Usually my parents are pretty chill, they never check my car or search my room. On NYE, I smoked some weed in my car and didn't think much of it. The next morning, I wake up to text from my dad and he was furious. He smelt the car and found gummy stickers, a lighter, and a receipt from the dispensary totaling $1000. The most unfortunate part was that the receipts for all of the carts, weed, gummies, etc, wasn't mine, but under my name, because I have a medical marijuana card.

So far my dad hasn't laid any punishments or grounded me - mainly because I am going to leave for on-campus at the University on the 18th. It's been 3 days and the annoying part is that he constantly texts me about the situation. I want to get through to his head that it's just fucking weed and not heroin or something. Since he allows me to drink alcohol, I can't see why he can't look at weed the same as he looks at alcohol.

To be honest, I'm not sure what to do. I have two weeks to kill before I get the fuck outta here for good.

TL;DR: indirectly got caught with weed

TIFU By thinking I could fix my kitchendrain myself.,t2_2v8bv0pd,"So I live in my apartment for about 1,5 years. The drain in my kitchen never went smooth.   
But it was manageable, I just had to wait for a couple of minutes, so no worries. 

Today I was cleaning my apartment and when I wanted to pour away all the dirty water. I found out that my drain didn't flow at all. So I thought this could be an easy fix. So I used a plunger to get the water to drain. Unfortunately this didn't work. I went to the store to get me some drain cleaner chemicals and poured it in. I Let it rest for about 2 hours (1 hour longer than needed, following the box) .

So I read online that most of the times the problem situates in the siphon. So I get myself a bucket, and I'm ready to unscrew the siphon. All the water gushes out, including the drain chemicals. Nothing to see in the siphon, so I thought it was fixed. I tried to put it all together again. Fortunately I manage to get it all to fit again. I let the water flow to see if it's fixed, but after the siphon is filled the water stays in the sink and won't drain at all.   
So I take it all apart again and I tried to pick in to the pipes in the wall with some iron wire. I feel something and I start to push against it with some force. I get through something and suddenly there flows a tsunami of dirty sink water out of the pipe, all over the cupboard and floor. Wet and smelly as fuck I think the problem is solved so I put the siphon back together. But I did something wrong and I hear something break. So I look at it and there is like a massive crack in one of the pipes. 

Now I'm here sitting here fully defeated, all wet and smelly. Waiting for the real plumber to come and help me out of my misery. 

TL;DR: I wanted to fix my kitchen drain myself and managed to break it all while getting covered in dirty smelly water. So now I have to wait for a real plumber to help me.",7
TIFU by clogging the toilet and ruining thanksgiving,t2_8zhn4f5e,"Throwaway account for reasons that will soon be obvious. Just thinking about this makes me want to wither away like a humiliated house plant that hasn’t been watered in a year. On mobile, sorry in advance, yadda yadda.

For context, at the time of this story I was 17. I’m a half-asian female of average height and build. I say this because no one expects me to have, ahem, *issues* with the toilet. You see, I have problems with staying hydrated and such, so my bowel movements are usually hard. Also, I don’t go no 2 more often than once every two or so days, so my bowel movements are on the bigger side.

This has caused me to have issues with flushing my business down the toilet. Going at home has a 75% chance of clogging in every house I’ve lived in. I never go at other people’s houses, which can be problematic. I usually love going in public restrooms because of the high powered flush (I’m getting one of those toilets one day, I swear), but I’ve even clogged a couple of those.

Anyway, this story takes place in a little southern United States town. My parents, my brother, one of my sisters, and I were visiting family for Thanksgiving in this little town. We rented a mobile home to stay in while we were there.

Thanksgiving comes and everyone is at our mobile home. While we ate, I felt the need to use the bathroom. I could tell I’d need to go no 2 and panicked. In the mobile home, there were two bathrooms: one for us kids and another for our parents in the master bedroom. I was near the master bedroom and didn’t want to walk all the way across the house to use the one for the kids, so I just snuck into the master bathroom and did the deed as quickly as I could.

When I was done, I very hesitantly pulled the lever down to flush. The toilet growled and struggled and, to my dismay, didn’t flush all the way. I waited and tried again. And again. And again. Nothing. I panicked and washed my hands quickly before leaving like nothing happened.

I forgot about it after a while until a few hours later when we were all sitting around chatting. My dad disappeared into the master bedroom only to come out a few moments later announcing “The toilet is clogged! Who clogged it??” in the loudest tone I had ever heard him yell. My dad is usually soft spoken so I have no idea why he felt the need to shout like he did.

Everyone looked at each other while denying any involvement with the clogged toilet as I felt all blood drain from my face. I couldn’t do anything other than try to look busy on my phone. Eventually, my brother piped up, “I saw op go into the bathroom earlier!” 

I didn’t know whether to strangle him or to lie down and let the earth reclaim me.

“Op, did you do this?” my dad demanded. I sputtered in embarrassment.

“I didn’t mean to! I thought it went down!” A lie.

“Well, now the toilet’s clogged and nothing will go down,” my dad grumbled, visibly pissed off. I heard snickers all around the room and I my embarassment only grew.

We decided to let it sit for a while longer so the turd could ‘disentegrate’ or something. Hours passed and my dad went back to check on it. Nope. The turd was having none of it and refused to oblige, despite my silent pleas.

“THE TOILET IS STILL CLOGGED!” my dad thundered across the room, alerting everyone in a five mile radius that his daughter had, in fact, dropped a massive turd that couldn’t be flushed.

By now, the snickers had returned with snide comments about me and my bowel issues. My dad searched the mobile home for a plunger, but  we had no such luck. “We might have to call the owners,” my dad said to everyone, “I don’t know how I’m going to explain this.”

The giggles had turned into all out laughing at me when my family heard this. I tried laughing with them, at first, but my humiliation began to overpower me and I started to sob. My insecure teenage ego was torn apart all at once. This only made my family laugh harder for whatever reason. But when my tears didn’t stop, they tried to comfort me while holding back their giggling.

All of their efforts to comfort me were undone when my mom stepped into the master bedroom for the first time since I had used it. Anyone with a Filipino mother will know how they are with bad smells. Her nostrils flared, her face scrunched up, and she exclaimed, “OH I CAN SMELL IT FROM HERE. OH IT’S SO BAD.” Then she made that sound where you cough and had gag at the same time. My siblings burst back into laughter and I had had enough. I went to bed holding back tears.

The next day I sulked, hardly leaving my room. The owner came and did what he could to make the toilet flush. Still nothing. This, of course, made everyone laugh all over again. My mom complained loudly. More laughs. I felt really awful. The smell did permeate and made eating kind of hard.

We ended up leaving the mobile home with the toilet STILL clogged. We never were able to fix it. My family brings it up ove once in a while and still lose their minds over it. And, after all these years, I still feel utterly humiliated. My mom and dad did apologize to me later saying that they did overreact, but the damage is done.

TL;DR: clogged the toilet in a small rental home and stunk the place up. We never could unclog it. It ruined thanksgiving.",46
TIFU by trying to sucking my husbands thumb sexily,t2_6dbdft5m,"So today has been a long stressful day between kids, life, pandemic, and all the stuff in between, so we decided to leave the phones, pack the kids up, and go get some fast food. It's a nice thing for them since they dont go out anymore and well, fast food. So after picking up some chicken nuggets and fries we was finally making it back home. Now its important to state our daughters, 6&amp;7, was in the first row in the back seats. So here is my chunky ass happily listening to the music, eating some fries, excited to finally get back home at which point my husband starts putting his thumb in my face back and fourth so, naturally, I thought he wanted a fry. I got one for him and he just shook his head no and started putting his thumb in my face again at which point the only thing that came to me in that moment was that 'oh he wants me to suck his thumb for suggestive purposes for later'. Don't ask why or how I got to that conclusion since nothing in that situation even remotely gave that hint, but I went for it at which point, as I'm just about to close my mouth, he moves his hand back trying to figure out what the hell was just about to happen and, at the same time, I realize that the reason he had his thumb there was to show me that the girls was dancing to the music and now, since they decide in that very second to pay attention to anything around them, I have both of them asking why I was about to bite dad's thumb and he hasn't stopped making jokes since. 

TL;DR- Husband's thumb in my face, he didnt want a fry so logically I tried to suck his thumb and now my daughters think I'm a cannibal and he is still laughing.",55
TIFU by using losing my tampon inside myself [NSFW],t2_8ruk9stu,"CW: tampon use 😅

Anyone who uses tampons can guess where this  is going. This was actually only an hour ago. I’m near the end of my period cycle and use tampons. I was feeling pretty horny and was ready to get down by my hot self, when I realized I still had a tampon in. I went to my bathroom to remove the tampon, pulled on the string and.... only the string came out. 

Ok, annoying but no big deal, I thought. This has happened before. I reach inside and feel the rouge tampon but can’t get a grip on it to pull it out.  I google how to remove a lost tampon and get moving on many different positions that are supposed to allow movement such as a squat, lying down, and having one leg up on a table. I still can’t get it out. 

The website suggests using lube so I lube myself up, when I realize it might help if there’s some natural lube inside, too. I get busy and get myself off with a toy, which does make it more slippery in there. I still can’t get it out and start to panic a bit. I call my doctor office and leave a message explaining what happened and that I need to see a doctor tomorrow morning ASAP to have it removed before I get toxic shock syndrome or an infection. I try to forget about it...

An hour later I get back to trying again. This time I’m thinking how can people possibly give birth if I can’t even remove a small tampon? I figure out a way to get multiple fingers inside and around my bits to mimic a clamp or something that might be used for birthing. I try many different relax and tense patterns before I FINALLY have a grip on the tampon, and am able to deliver it like a newborn baby. No more being vacuumed up into my organs for you! I am relieved until I realize the doctor’s receptionist is going to call me back tomorrow morning ...

TLDR: tampon string broke, left a voice message with doctor saying I needed help right away, basically gave birth to tampon, awaiting doctors call back tomorrow.",24
TIFU Cringe Moment At A Friend's Wedding,t2_12xp8d,"This happened a long time ago. I was young, and as you will soon find out, very dumb and socially awkward.

I had a guy friend whom I met while out clubbing in my very early 20's. He started dating a really nice girl. I eventually befriended the girl as well. They got engaged somewhat quickly and the day of the wedding had arrived.

The groom was not close with his family, so they didn't attend the wedding. There was no wedding party and the guests were all of the bride's family/friends. I didn't know a single one of them and instead of recognizing this as an opportunity to meet new people, my anxiety riddled, introverted ass mostly hung out with the bride and tried to be helpful if she needed anything. 

I went to the bathroom and heard noises coming from one of the stalls. I began worrying that this person might need some kind of help that I was 100% not equipped to provide, but I also didn't want to make a scene. I wondered how to resolve this discreetly without alerting guests. So what did I do? I STUPIDLY went to the bride and told her. She replied, ""Yes, I know. It's my mother and she's been crying in the bathroom for a while now. She doesn't approve of the marriage and is really upset about it."" 

🤦‍♀️ This was news to me and I was all OMG, what have I done? 😱 Just instant regret for all of my actions. 

TLDR: Bride's mother was crying in the bathroom because she didn't approve of marriage. I stupidly went and reported to the bride that ""someone in the bathroom might need help"".",0
TIFU by inadvertently showing my boyfriend a Facebook photo of his ex I had saved on my phone,t2_69tumcgn,"I recently reunited with my boyfriend after breaking up over a year ago. During the time we were split up he dated someone else that ended up moving to the small town we live in. It destroyed me when I found out she was moving in with him. Out of curiosity I looked her up on Facebook and saved a screenshot of her profile photo to my phone’s “hidden” album. 

Well today we were looking through photos of some trips I had taken in the last year and the screenshot I’d saved of his now-ex popped up. I didn’t know what to say except that I was curious what she looked like and was jealous of her being with him at the time. He joked that I had been stalking her. I apologized and just said how embarrassed I was. He said he didn’t care, but I haven’t been able to shake this feeling of shame and embarrassment—every time I think about it I cringe. 

I guess we all make mistakes, but I can’t stop beating myself up about the fact that I felt the need to look her up and how stupid it was to not delete the photo after I’d looked at it. I hope he doesn’t judge me too harshly for this.

TL;DR: I looked up my bf’s ex on FB and today I showed him the screenshot I’d saved of her profile pic.",6
TIFU by not realizing that zoom doesn't mirror your video on other people's screens,t2_89wgspi5,"So today I found out that zoom doesn't mirror your video in other people's view. I had my video settings set to ""mirror video"" and just assumed the mirrored view of myself would be what everyone else sees. Well, IT'S NOT. 

Here's where I messed up: I can get anxious during zoom meetings, so I sometimes secretly hold a stuffed animal to help me feel better. On my screen, I always make sure to hide the stuffed animal behind the little box that says my name so that people can't tell that I'm holding a stuffed animal. Someone mentioned something about it to me at one of my zoom meetings, so I just assumed that I had accidentally moved the stuffed animal into view. Since then, I have been extra, extra careful with my positioning of the stuffed animal--making sure that it never moves from its hiding place behind my name box.

I was bored during a long meeting today and decided to mess around with my video settings. I unchecked the box for the mirror video setting and realized that not only was my red panda build a bear visible, I had positioned myself so closely to the corner that I thought was hiding him that I had accidentally actually placed him in an awkwardly prominent place. I messaged my friend who was in the meeting like ""wtf,, everyone can see that I'm holding a stuffed animal right now??!?"" and they said ""yeah, I just thought it was really cute."" 

So, it turns out that I--a 21-year-old dude--have been holding a stuffed animal IN FULL VIEW of everyone else in multiple zoom meetings FOR WEEKS. FML

TLDR: didn't realize that zoom flips your video on other people's screens, meaning that everybody has been able to see that I (21 M) hold stuffed animals during my zoom meetings",2054
TIFU By Testing My Lock picking Skills,t2_11i4zl,"Some backstory: I brought a lockpicking set from amazon a few days back, its one of those with a seethrough acrylic lock and some flimsy picks, backstory over, story time.

so I'm sitting at my desk, playing with said lockpicks, and have the frightfully spiffing idea to test how long it will take me to remove the lock from my toe.

FU no.1

I placed the lock around my big toe and set out to start picking it, its all going well and it should be off in no time, oh how wrong could i be? Remember how i mentioned that they were flimsy lockpicks? it snapped. Inside the lock. On my toe.Oh, no problem, i think to myself, i'll just get the key.

FU no.2

So i probably should of checked where the key was beforehand, but as i was so confident in my skills as a locksmith, I assured myself i would not need it, so i placed it somewhere that i don't know.

Fastfoward to now and i'm sitting in my chair, with a lock stuck to my big toe, and i have no way to get it off.

Liz was a part of the woman's sports team at my college. She got around a bit through my team and eventually formed a truple with another teammate and me. We'd all see other people but for the most part we would go home together.

My friend and I later found out she was engaged and had been for almost a year. I met her BF while her and I were sitting tables for our athletic volunteer hours. They dated for 4 years or so prior.

She did have a ring but switched fingers frequently since her fingers would swell from some condition. It wasn't flashy or anything, so we all just thought it was a family heirloom or something. 

Her fiance came up to the tables joking and then he hugged and kissed her. My eyes went up but I didn't want to say anything. I really didn't know what to say... Like, ""aye man, my dude and I gangbanged your fiancèe"". Why would he believe me over her? Thinking back now I could have shown him her pics but it all happened so quick and I was so shocked.

After I met him I hoped and prayed that something would happen so that he found out about everyone she's been sleeping with on the side. But there is no happy ending to this story.

I bring this up because they look so damn happy and he was so fucking clueless when he came up to me at the table. It legit hurt my heart knowing that she could be so, idk what to call it...

People really can just look someone dead in the eye, tell them they love them, then go have a full on secret gangbang. I just, never want to date. Trust issues from that situation really fucked me up.

How can you even tell when someone is genuine? It's like a legit leap of faith.

Tl;dr: teammate and I would have regular group sex with someone on the woman's athletic team not knowing that she was engaged. Found out by meeting him face to while we all were sitting tables, he didn't know and didn't find out from what I can tell. They're married now with multiple kids.

Edit:. I have zero intentions on bringing this up to him ever. This was more so a, you can never really know a person.  

Also I know he didn't know because I confronted her later that night and she told me to mind my business. That was our last interaction. I'd think of he knew she would have just said that. Things were really good between us prior to that event.",16
"TIFU by trying (as always) and narely harming, maybe even killing, my dad",t2_1dizhfy1,"&amp;#x200B;

Little background:

This happened on Saturday, not today.

English is my 2nd language, please respect.

My dad works in a car shop. It is quite small with only a few employees so repairing your car on weekends/holidays is normal. My dad also isn't very mobile, he walks with crutches and probably will for the rest of his life. He also can drive very well and isn't a slow driver by any means. He doesn't drive like a pshychopath, just a bit faster than other normal drivers around. I (M18) recently got my license and I drive not like my father, but still kinda fast, not that much tho. As I want learn to drive nicely as fast as possible, I drive when I can. I also have some small skill in car repairin, specially from watching YT. Now to the fuck up...

I(M18) was trying to change faucet in a very badly accessible place in our bathroom. As it was unaccessible with side spanner, I needed deep socket. Sadly we don't have any at home, so me and my dad went at his work place (car shop) to borrow some tools. When I started to drive I felt some weird feeling in front tires, they were like if they weren't round. I immediately stopped and went to look at it. It was completely flat. I reversed back in parking place and went for a compressor to the boot. When the tire was full I waited for a minute to check if it was possible to even get somewhere and it was so we headed out.

When we arrived at dads work it was still kinda full, but anyway we started to investigate. My dad found a screw stuck in the tire, at very sharp angle. I jacked up the car, broke bolts on the wheel loose and unscrew them with impact driver. We were able to fix the tire with the help of my knowledge from internet and a video I recommended (from Chrisfix). It was already very dark when the tire was ready to be put back on the car and I parked outside the shop, as there wasn't room inside. **And there is where the fuck up started...** I put the wheel on the hub, and because I had a few problems with putting a wheel on a car right in the past, I wasn't really sure what I was doing. I grabbed a bolt and put the wheel on the hub, found a place, where the bolt screwed into and thought it was alright. Threaded all the other bolt through the wheel to the hub by hand and then used impact driver to tightened them. I then checked if they were tightened well with torque wrench. I tightened them at 130 Nm, lowered the car, filled the tire with air and it was done. We headed home. On the way when parking i felt like the wheel is doing weird noises, but thought it's just normal stuff, as basically last thing I heard was an empty wheel.

Today, when my dad drove to work, he heard the same thing. On the way to his work he stopped several times and felt that there was some gap between the wheel and the hub with his nail. This gap wasn't at any other wheel, just on the one I put on. After second stop the car was really hard to control, so he stopped and saw, that 3 of 5 bolts were missing. He called his coleague who came and helped him put the wheel well on. It ended well, but just the thought that I could have been the one, who was responsible for his crash is a bad thought. There are several video on YT of people driving with only three wheels, but image you are going more than 100 km/h and suddenly one of your wheels just flies away... BTW the tire is still alright and not flat, so that is at least something good i guess.

TL;DR Found a flat tire on my dad's car, repaired it, put wheel back on the car wrong, and the wheel nearly came loose while my dad drove to the work.",2
TIFU by losing a grand because I backed out of a trip that I didn’t think I should be going on during a pandemic. Parents disagree with my choice.,t2_8n0sk95c,"A few friends and I (early 20s wfh) thought it would be a nice escape from living with our parents by driving to Florida and staying in an airbnb for a month together. We got one with a pool so we would only have to leave to go to the grocery store. We booked back in Oct 2020 for February 2021 pretty hopeful that things would get better. The deal is we get tested before and quarantine after the trip. And as three months have passed and numbers are rising and ICUs are full....I feel that it would be so disrespectful to humanity if I went.  

For weeks I have been feeling that it’s such a slap in the face to healthcare workers and to those who are strictly quarantining (which I have been and still am doing) if I left my house and stayed elsewhere with different people for a month. i still feel that it is so wrong. People have been absolutely judging me for not backing out and I judged myself equally so. My friends are still going.

I feel like in the grand scheme of things losing $1000 isn’t a huge deal for doing the right thing. I feel that i want to do the right thing in this pandemic yet my parents are saying I shouldn’t let the judgements of others stop me from doing something while taking all precautions...am I making the right decision? Or letting other peoples judgements rule my life as the suggest? 

TL;DR Backed out of a monthly stay to quarantine at an airbnb in FL, feel that it would disrespect everyone during this pandemic, losing $1000... right decision?",1
TIFU by send my crush a pic of herself,t2_7ni5zrb4,"This happened earlier this week. I was sitting in my room when my friend who i hadn’t spoken to in like 8 months started texting me. 

The convo was a little awkward and they then FaceTimed me. I had to do something first so i said I would call them back. About a half an hour later, i called them back and we caught up on what happened in the past few months. I basically told them my entire life story as of 8 month earlier. They caught me up on their stuff and said that they became a witch. I have no problem with witchy things and I let them give me a tarot reading. I asked the deck weather or not my crush like me back. I honestly didn’t think that she did but I figured that I’d humour myself. She pulled a card and had to look it up, the deck said yes. Im an atheist so i figured it was a pure coincidence. I asked my friend if she wanted to see the person that I had a crush on, and they did. So I went to my crushes insta and screen shotted her latest post. I went to go message my friend the picture but I accidentally sent my crushes insta post to my crush. Not immediately noticing this, I asked my friend what they thought and they did see it. I looked and saw my crushed name right at the top of my phone. I was now in sheer panic, and i ask my friend what to do. They said to say oops. so I did. I then said “fuck it, i might as well tell her to truth.” So I sent her a short message explaining that I had a crush on her and that i was telling my friend about her. I also apologised for being weird and I hung up with my friend so I could try to FaceTime my crush. She didn’t answer, I was getting increasingly more anxious and I didn’t know what to do. I barely got any sleep that night and I woke up in the morning to nothing. I called her again, and still nothing. So I texted her a few more times before she responded with “I thought we were just friends” Naturally I wanted to make sure she wouldn’t abandon me, and she assured me she was still my friend. I am still single, but that took some confidence to not lie. 

TL;DR - I accidentally sent a pic of my crush to my crush instead of my other friend and I decided to be honest about my feelings. She didn’t share those feeling with me.

Edit: Im a girl btw",12
TIFU by giving my dog fried chicken bones,t2_1256cu,"Not really something that happened today but something that came to manifest over time. My gdad had always warned me not to give em to em out of fear it’ll get stuck in his throat. Yeah no they got stuck in his stomach and colon instead. That’s why this is a fuck up. I was warned and now our family is paying dearly for it. Lost a family member today and I’m just really fucking hurt right now.

Over the past couple months my German Shep, Macx, had really been struggling to poop. At first we chalked it up to constipation so we just changed up his diet to help make his stool a little easier to pass. When that didn’t really work took him to the vet and they said it was is inflamed prostate that was preventing him from pooping with ease. So they gave us some medicine and told us to come back in a couple weeks to check. Well nothing had really helped. Took him to the humane society because they had gotten a grant and were footing the bill on anything you needed, even surgeries. They did a lot of tests and found he had a ton of bone fragments in his stomach and colon and that’s why it was so hard for him. Stuff just wouldn’t pass without it being painful. They gave us some medicine and some food that’ll help with passing the bone. They still didn’t really help. He ate the first couple days and was even able to get some shit out but man you could really tell it was hurting him. He stopped eating after a minute. At first I thought it was the medicine I had mixed in with the food turning him off. But even when I gave it to him by itself he wouldn’t eat. And it’s not like he didn’t like the food, hell the first days he would clear the bowl and wait on more. So took him to the vet today and they said it wasn’t really anything else we could do for him and they had to put him down today. 

He was our family’s first dog. Had him for about 6 years now. Gone way too soon. I’ll always miss you Macxy:(

TL;DR: Fed dog bones. Dog stopped pooping. Dog needed to be put down. Sadness.",0
TIFU - By troubleshooting the Xfinity box in the living room.,t2_3385ur33,"Turns out our Xfinity box doesn't detect the 4K UHD as a result of the receiver box being the bottleneck (AVR-1912). So I graciously being confused as this a Hisense 4K TV why it was showing up at 1080p. Used a personal HDMI cable of mine one I knew was at least 4K compatible but I had a backup in case it wasn't. I was troubleshooting when all of the sudden the aunt walks in and I'm explaining why this is a problem but she's not technologically savvy so in her eyes I was messing up the TV. Then of course the sound doesn't work as a result of me switching the HDMI cable, the one connected the to receiver box which produces the audio as we have a surround system in the living room. So disconnecting it leaves the audio null and void. So I reconnected the original HDMI cable and now the audio works just fine.

TL;DR But I did fix the problem she was just so mad at me anyways. Today I Fucked Up but I fixed my fuck up. Fucked up the surround system on my living room TV.",0
TIFU by cheating myself out of selling my car by not knowing geography,t2_d634y8c,"Obligatory: this was a few years ago.  

When I moved from the east coast to San Francisco, my goal was to sell my car and live that city lifestyle. I listed my car on Craigslist, and I was surprised that I got very few legitimate responses. So I would drop the price about $100 every other a day, and I was starting to get frustrated that I still had to deal with my car that I wasn’t using (moving it daily for street sweeping, circling around for parking, parallel parking backwards up hill).

I finally got an email from an interested party. Craigslist is full of scammers and you have to carefully sift through the responses, so I set up a call to talk about the car. They liked what they heard, they seemed legitimate, everything was going well. Then they asked if they could drive over to check it out. I said of course, and just casually asked where they were coming from. “Pittsburgh” they replied. I distinctly remember changing my tone and being curt and saying “thanks but no thanks” as I didn’t want to wait for someone to cover the 2,700 miles before they could test drive my car. 

It took another week, but I eventually sold the car to a family in Berkeley. Only after dropping the price another $400 of course. 


About a month later I’m riding the BART (regional train) for the first time and I’m looking at the map, and lo and behold at the very end of the yellow line, not at all far from the city, is Pittsburg, California. In my defense, the missing ‘h’ at the end of the word isn’t spoken. 

TL;DR: After moving to the Bay Area I screwed myself out of selling my car to a potential buyer when I thought they were calling from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, not knowing of another Pittsburg about 15 miles from me.",160
Tifu by bringing up USA not having free healthcare to my very American grandmother,t2_9b0mwo11,"I had saw something on the news about this doctor forgiving hospital debts after he treated her and I brought up the fact that it was sad that a woman not paying for healthcare made nationwide news. I then made the mistake of bringing up that we were the only country in the world without free healthcare while my *very* American grandmother was in hearing distance so she went on a rant about “oh, if we make healthcare free then we will be just like a communist country” and when I asked her to explain, she said that we would get the free stuff  but we would also lose all of our freedoms as well. So I said to her “ So a man should die because he doesn’t have enough money to pay the hospital bill?” And she replied with “ Yes, because that’s why you go to college so you can the better paying jobs”. I then brought up that some people can’t afford college and she replied with “oh you can get a grant or loan if you need to but a lot of people get in because of good grades so you better start working to get those grades up”. I just stopped trying to argue with her and went to get my phone so I could post this.

TL;DR: I brought up America not having free healthcare, my grandmother went on a rant about how free healthcare is bad.",2

TIFU by humiliating my best friend in front of a group of online friends...,t2_472b0l52,"So basically, I (17) have anxiety issues, and I overthink alot. My best friend (16) knows this and she's always been very understanding, I always have anxiety that she's gonna leave me or stop being my friend, but she accepted that I can't help it and she's happy to clear any doubts in me about me and her.
Anyways, one day I ask her not to tell someone about my sister, cos he seemed interested in her type, after a while she told him, cos she said she trusted him with that information and he wasn't going to try and hit on her.
I felt really anxious and triggered, and I basically was saying a bunch of stuff to her in front of the groupchat, she tried to calm things down but I was just going off like a steam train, eventually she got hurt that everyone saw me being rude to her and she felt really really bad afterwards. I thought it was alright cos she said she would understand but I realised I hurt her when I called her a liar by saying she cared, in front of the group chat, so she became really upset
She hasn't spoken to me yet

TIFU and forgot to turn off my camera...,t2_8yw3gjpe,"So before I start the story, a really short backstory:

In September, I started 9th grade. In our country's school system, whenever we, students start 9th grade, we have to join a new school with other classmates. In my new class, there are 37 students (this includes me) and only 7 of these are boys (I'm a boy too). 

So, let's get into the story.

School has been fully online since September and we haven't met each other yet. Because of this, we often do conversations on Zoom. There are about 6-7 people in these conversations, although when we first started doing them, most of the class took part.

I join most of these conversations, and every time I've joined, I was the only boy in there. All the other 5-6 people were girls and usually the same people.

On avarage, we have 1 or 2 of these conversations per week, so I know a lot about these girls. One of them is pretty weird (not like anyone in the world is normal, cause I'm also the biggest weirdo in the universe, but she is outstandingly weird).

Let's call this girl Emma. So in a conversation about 2 months ago, she said the following, ignoring that I was there too (don't ask me what we were talking about, I don't remember): ""I actually like to wear short clothes and to act in a way which makes guys horny. I know that I have a stunning body and I take advantage of that, cause I know that guys would do anything for me if they like my body.""

I know this is a weird thing to say and people will start to not believe me here but, she did say that. Before I continue, I just want to say that I'm not the type of guy who would do anything for a sexy girl, cause I will not fall in love with a girl just because they have a great body.

But... I gotta admit, I do become horny most of the times when I see Emma. She usually wears clothes that only cover the lower half of her breasts and she does generally act in a sexy way - on purpose. For example, she often pretends that she has to pull up her shirt constantly because it's sliding down, when in reality, she makes it obvious that SHE is pulling her shirt down just a tiny bit constantly, so that she has to pull it up constantly, so that she can make a big deal out of it. Anyways.

So yesterday, Emma, 4 other girls and me were in a Zoom call. We all turned our cameras on, and Emma was sitting in front of the camera with wet hair and a very tiny bra. She said that she just had a bath and she was just drying her hair, but she thought she'll join the call anyways and dry her hair during the call.

One of the other girls asked her why she didn't at least put on actual clothes, and she said: ""Gosh, I'll put some on after drying my hair. I though you'd like if I joined the conversation in time, so I did."" In my opinion, this is kinda a weird excuse and she was just trying to ""show"", cause these conversations usually go on for 3-4 hours, but... I'm probably wrong. Although this isn't really normal from a girl in my opinion. Or even from just a person. Who would join a call with one or more people from the other gender, when they are without ""actual clothes"" and have wet hair.

Anyways. So, I was currently wearing pretty tight jeans and underpants (I don't have many clothes, and when I woke up only these were dried lol) and I was getting hard, so I knew it would become uncomfortable on the ""southern parts"" after a short while.

Since I woke up, some of my sweatpants got dried and I knew it would be more comfortable in those, so I made up the following ridiculous excuse: ""I gotta go for a few minutes, I'll be right back"", I turned off my camera and mic, stood up, I pulled down my jeans and underpants (as I said, those were pretty tiny too) and I got some other underpants and some sweatpants.

After I finished dressing up, I sat back next to my computer, I clicked on the camera button and... instead of my camera screen or whatever, Zoom was showing my name. I knew what this meant: my camera didn't turn off and all the girls saw everything.

I was extremely embarassed, I left the call and I only joined back after a few minutes. Then I just stared at the screen. All 5 girls were laughing, but I was crying inside. After a minute or so, the girls finally stopped laughing and Emma said: ""So, which one of us made you horny?"" And then they continued laughing.

At that moment, I felt like I had two choices. I could either run away and leave the call or be brave, stay there and make fun of the situation. I decided that the second one would be a better choice. It would show that I don't make a big deal out of this and thus, the other girls would also not do so. Also, the other thing I thought was that running away and not facing the consequences of a mistake is not a great choice, doesn't matter what the mistake is.

So, I stayed there and replied to Emma: ""You"", then I started laughing on purpose. They also continued to laugh. Then, after we all stopped laughing (and Emma dried her hair and put on some actual clothes off-camera), we had an absolutely normal conversation and nobody brought it up that day anymore.

I dunno why I wrote down this story, but I felt so embarassed at that moment and I still can't frickin believe this happened, I just had to write it down.

Hopefully they won't bring this story up in the future but if they do, I'm gonna share that.

One last thing: sorry for my bad english and any miswritten words (that might be cause of english or cause of autocorrect)

TL;DR: I changed clothes, but forgot to turn off my camera while in a Zoom call with 5 other girls. Tgey saw my cock while I was hard. When I realized it, instead of leaving the call, I faced the consequences and laughed at myself.",189
TIFU by constantly shouting rape in a foreign country,t2_3x04p9gl,"Obligatory didn't happen today, but it's one of those fck ups I always have to chuckle about when thinking about it.

So about 2 years ago I lived a few months in a city in the mountains of Vietnam. I've made some local friends my age (one of whom is called Hiệp) and we had lots of fun spending time together. Now they have this thing in their culture, where they really don't want to embarrass someone else by e.g. pointing out a mistake they are making.

Another important thing to keep in mind is that in Vietnam, depending on your voice the meaning of a word can change. And it can change dramatically. Since it's not the same for my mother tongue, I didn't really give it too much attantion.

I think you can imagine where this is going.

So in one of the last weeks I spent there, some friends tried to tell me in a really polite way, that I might want to watch how I pronounce my friends name ""Hiệp"", because I always spell it ""Hiếp"" (go find the difference...) and that basically means rape in Vietnamese.... When they told me I didn't know if I should be embarrassed or laugh, but the only thing that went through my head were all the moments I called my friend. In the supermarket, in restaurants, bars, with his family, etc.... I CONSTANTLY SHOUTED RAPE in public and no one felt the need to correct me until the very last moment. I appreciate their politeness and I still wonder what other people thought about me when they heared me calling my friend.

I was never really sure if they trolled me or not, but I finally looked it up and apparently they didn't.

TL;DR By mispronouncing my Vietnamese friends name ""Hiệp"" I constantly shouted rape (""Hiếp"") whenever I called him.",3
Tifu by screaming too loud that my cats did me dirty.,t2_6dejalns,"Setting: It's January. The cats are out and about tryna get laid and fornicate. My ghetto ass building ain't got no gate so cats can waltz up and down the stairs however they please.

I have two cats who are regularly fed by my parents, but they are technically stray cats. They usually hang about our front door.

I was just browsing the intertwebs minding my own business when I hear cats shrieking and freaking tf out. I run to the front door to protect my cats from other alpha males and fling it open, screeching the loudest screech I could muster (I am usually able to get to quite painful pitches, especially when angered/in a state of rage and motherly protectiveness).

One of the cats (and to be honest im not quite sure if it was mine or the intruder who was tryna bully it) scrammed down the strairs, zooming at full speed whilst simultaneously shitting it self.

This left a trail of poop. I never knew cats could produce this amount of excrement. It was all over the staircase. We had to call someone to clean it. I can still smell the faint odour.

TIFU by accidentally training my puppy to be a drug sniffer dog,t2_ih2mqc,"Obligatory not today, this happened 4 years ago.

During my second last year of high school our family got a new dog (poodle x labrador). It was during the end of year break and my whole family was working full time so I had the whole house to myself all day. I am not a regular smoker and haven't smoked weed in at least 6 months but at this point I was smoking every day for pretty much the whole holidays.

 I had a routine where I would wake up, make myself some breakfast, and then go outside for a joint. The dog at this point was about 6-8 months old (coincidentally the perfect time to start training) and was very playful and energetic. To counteract this, when I went outside with my weed I would take a handful of treats and feed them to her so she wouldn't annoy me while I was trying to roll.

I had already taught her to sit before I gave her each treat, however during this period of wake-bake-repeat she would come out with me and sniff around the bag with my weed, rolling papers and other paraphernalia in it (which at this point stunk because I'd used it for months). In between doing this, and me telling her to sit and then feeding her a reward, retrospectively it's pretty easy to see what was going to happen.

Anyway, after maybe 2 weeks or so of this routine, I had finished smoking one day and was back up in my room and the bag full of goodies was lying on my floor. Cue the puppy walking in, proceeding to nudge and sniff around the bag, and then sitting right in front of it staring straight at me. At this point I was pretty high so it didn't hit me immediately but the second it did I could not stop laughing for 10 minutes straight.

I was sure I was imagining things as I was high, so a couple hours later when it had all worn off, I tried it several times more with near identical results. Nothing ever came of it even though it happened several times more but I can't say I wasn't terrified for months that my dog was going to snitch me out to my parents by finding my stash.

TL;DR I fed my dog treats while sniffing weed and now she's a narc",579

"TIFU by offending my ""New family""",t2_27jpvq9o,"**A little bit of ""pre-story""**

So a couple of years ago my parents got divorced and not too long ago I got to meet my dads ""new family"" meaning his soon-to-be wife and her 3 children. All 3 of them are my age (late teens) or older.

So we planned to go to this waterpark and stay there for 3 days, just so we can get to know each other.

My dad is an extreme meat eater, he cannot stand eating salads or anything green on it's own, he always has got to eat meat next to it; he also cannot stand vegetarians and always makes sure to point it out.

""Sarah"" is one of my stepsisters.

**To the main story:**

So, I get picked up by my dad, we drive to the waterpark and arrive at the summerhouse that we have rented for 3 days, where I meet his new family (my stepmom, 4 stepsisters, and one of their boyfriends). They are quite possibly some of the most awkward people in the world and have absolutely no sense of humor. So after standing in the summerhouse and awkwardly chit-chatting, we decide to go out and get something to eat.

When we arrive at the restaurant (you guessed it) the mood is extremely awkward. So my dad starts talking, and starts talking about the steak he has just gotten and how great it is. Because the table is so silent, I try to get my dad to start some conversation, since he is the only person at the table who actually doesn't look like a statue; I then slide in a comment about my chicken wings and state that *""I could never stand being a vegetarian""* because I love chicken. My dad giggles a little bit, the same way that he always does when he is about to to sh\*ttalk vegetarians. (I expected my dad to pick up on my comment, since he always sh\*ttalks vegetarians). He turns to me, nods, and quietly (only I could hear it) says that *he thinks vegetarians are dumb people*, I answer with *""Well, a little strange, but not exactly dumb. But that's just because I can't imagine being a vegetarian.""*

After a couple of seconds of silence, he slowly turns to me and loudly says *""Oh, you can just ask (Lets call her Sarah) about being a vegetarian, since you think they are strange, she's a vegetarian...""* Suddenly my dad and the 5 other people at the table are staring at me in silence. I then nervously and blurt out *""Well, you're a vegetarian, that's totally understandable, atleast you're not a vegan, cause that is really weird""* In a horrible attempt to lighten the mood.

""*Uhh, I'm not vegetarian... I am a vegan...*"" she replies, and the table becomes dead silent; she becomes extremely angry and leaves. We half an hour later find out that she drove home and refused to come back to the waterpark... the 3 remaining days, his family just stares at me as if I'm some sort of monster who called ""Sarah"" a dumbass or something; they barely even talked to me... It's safe to say that I won't be seeing much of his new family.

Last time I saw the family was a couple of weeks ago, this thing happened many months ago; and they still carry a grudge...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR; My dad who always rants about vegetarians, kinda ""baited"" me into starting a rant about vegetarians in front of my step-family who I just met. He tells me to ask ""Sarah"" about how life is as a vegetarian. I respond with *""Well, you're a vegetarian, that's totally understandable, atleast you're not a vegan, cause that is really weird.""* in an attempt to lighten the awkward mood at the table. She then corrects me and says she actually is a vegan; she becomes so offended that she drives home from the waterpark and refuses to come back. Now my entire stepfamily seems to hate me.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1:

It seems that someone got offended by this, since they decided to PM me. To clarify I don't have anything against vegetarians or vegans, to be honest I couldn't care less about what people put in their mouth. It was just something that I said, because I kind of was panicking since I hate silences, and got kind of ""desperate"" for someone to actually talk. So no, I am not a ""Vegephobe"" or whatever you want to call it.",13
TIFU cause my girlfriend thinks I have a small dick,t2_6fk2ujo1,"So basically I've been seeing this girl for a few weeks now. Last weekend she came over while my parents were out. We ordered a pizza and watched some show on netflix. After a few episodes, she grabbed me by the hand and began leading me somewhere. I was rock hard and she was wearing booty shorts so I knew it was time to smash. She asked me where my room was and I told her to guess. She picked the wrong door, my brother's room. He had his hentai porn posters all over the wall and a bottle of lotion on his bed. A little bit of the lotion was on his sheets. Now, whether that was lotion or something else, we sure as hell didn't stick around long enough to find out

We walked out and shut the door behind us. I told her where my room is.  I was so excited to smash but when we walked in there was a few boxes of extra small condoms. Those were the ones my brother uses on the rare occasion he gets lucky and for some reason he left them in my room. She giggled a little before closing her mouth with her hand. I told her these weren't mine but obviously she was skeptical. ""*F\*ck it""* I thought to myself. I grabbed my waist and desperately began trying to take my jeans off so she can see I don't have a small dick. But over the holidays I gained a few pounds. I've always been a smaller guy and you wouldn't really be able to notice but the jeans were tight to begin with. As I was struggling and groaning, she told me she has to leave and walked out

I'm really pissed off now and I don't have the balls to message her because I'm too embarrassed

tldr: my jackass brother left his extra small condoms in my room and my girlfriend thinks they were mine",0
TIFU by sniffing really hard after a sneeze.,t2_jcfuvjl,"A tiny bit of backstory.. I had an emergency appendectomy on December 30th. 2020 shanked me on the way out.

So I had a random ass nose bleed like an hour and a half ago, right? Got it to stop. We’re good. Then like 20 minutes ago I’m in the shower. I feel a sneeze coming. I’m full on yelling at myself telling myself not to sneeze. Because that shit hurts. And because, of course, I had just had a fucking nosebleed.

It didn’t work. I started sneezing. I’m holding my stomach trying not to hurt, at the same time trying not to sniff or blow my nose when I feel something at the back of my throat... So I sniffed. Hard. My body said, “F you, Bethula, we do what we WANT”. And I choked on the clot. That shit rockets across the shower as I sneeze again, yelping because I forgot to hold my tummy because I was concerned with the ick. It looked like a whole ass murder scene. Blood. Everywhere. And now I’m dying laughing. Which also hurts.

TLDR: Sneezed while in the shower after appendectomy and nosebleed, sniffed, sneezed, loud murder scene.",50
TIFU by giving out to an autistic child at work,t2_194ls52n,"
Happened a number of years back at a music shop where I worked.

Was behind the counter and a 13/14 year old and his grandmother came up to the counter. I was in my early 20s and had no knowledge of autism or how it impacts peoples behaviour 

He asked something like

'Do you have Fallout 3' in a very aggressive manner 

I replied with
'On which console?'

He fires back with even more anger
'DO YOU HAVE FALLOUT 3?'

I was a  bit annoyed now and asked again
'On which console?'

He comes back again and goes
'DO YOU HAVE FALLOUT 3!?'

I was pissed now and go
'Please don't talk to me like that, it's very rude. If you can be more polite, I'll be happy to help'

The boy doesn't take any notice of what I say but the granny interjects now and goes
'How dare you speak to him like that, he has autism' and they storm off.

I caught eye contact with another customer and they gave me a half sympathy/half you  fucking donkey kind of look.

I still randomly think about it at 3am and it makes me  cringe a lot

TLDR
Gave out to an autistic kid because I was too dumb to realise he had autism and thought he was being rude instead",14
TIFU by finding a lifeless body while breaking in a school illegally,t2_76fw82w7,"so as in every post, this happened several years ago. i will try to keep the story as short as possible

so me and a friend have the great tradition of breaking in a school once a year. we use to go into the school in the evening, then hide in two lockers until everyone left. then we usually have a great time by ourselves drinking and eating snacks. 
there have been a few occasions, where really crazy stuff happened, but the wildest one is this: 
we just came out of the lockers and wanted to start the party. as we walked down the stairs to get our booze, we saw what we thougt was a dead boby outside the building. to give some context, it was nighttime and winter, so dark and cold af. we are at that point kind of panicking. we cant call the police and tell them where we have seen the body??
so we put a little stone between the door, so we can come in again later, bc we had all our stuff in the school. we go on the roof of the school, where you can go to even when the school is closed. luckily, the body is also visible from there, it lays like on the edge of the roof, but not a roof where you should go, like further down. 
so we call the police and tell them we saw a body. a few minutes later, the police, firemen and an ambulance arrive. they get the 'body'. its a boy, around 14 years of age. he is drunk af, cant respond to them and has a broken collarbone and is under normal temperature. 
they take him to the hospital and begin to ask us stuff. we lie a lot bc they ask us why we are here, where we have seen him etc. they even brought a detective, who should ask us seperatly, so were in a reeally dumb situation, bc we didnt talk about an alibi. 
so we tell them that we really wanna go home, were so tired etc, and they let us go. all the police cars etc are standing right in front of the door we put a stone in between... in a brief moment, we sprint to the door and run inside again, where we drank ourselves to sleep

so yeah turns out the boy was drinking with his friend. his friend fell asleep, meanwhile he fell down the roof. his friend wakes up, cant see him and decides to go home, what left the boy in the cold, asleep/ unconcious.

moral of the story: something a little illegal can save someones life!

TL ; DR i broke in a school, saw a liveless body out of the window, on the roof. had to lie to the police a bit, then snuck inside the school again and drank booze

TIFU Having my dog die and missing out in potentially one of my most important meetings of the year.,t2_14g6j818,"So to pre-face this happened December 30th 2020, which was just the cherry on top this shitty year needed. Another important detail, my dog (being an old lady in her prime of beauty) has been having internal bleeding for a few years now.

I'm currently a film student and trying to get into a good film school, so one of my best friends got their cousin who is apparently very connected to set a day with me and shed some wisdom to how the industry works, what to study and focus on, all that fun stuff. 

I have prepared a week prior to that day a reel, 2 shorts, a list of questions, and even my college application reel. Hell, I even got a haircut! To say I was esctatic is an understatement. 

Day of the meeting is set for 2pm. I wake up at 9am, cook breakfast and everything is set. Out of nowhere, my dog is bleeding. A lot. My family we clean her blood usually as it's a little bit amd we always tell her it's okay and it's not her fault, bless her since she always gets nervous when it happened. But this time was too much blood, so we call a vet and drive an hour away. It's okay, we can get there and get back in time, I'll shower for the meeting. Easy? Wrong. The doctor refuses all surgeries for the next few days due to new years. We take my dog and drive over to a more expensive vet. I definitely cannot afford the surgery and neither could my brother but fuck it because we love her. It's another long drive and the whole time I'm playing her favorite songs including Miss American Pie. We get to the vet, fill out the papers and wait. At this moment we are only 2 miles away from my house so once she goes under for surgery I can head home. 

I can't explain why but the doctors take fucking forever. I keep being beside my dog petting her with my brother. It's 1:20pm. I tell him I'm going to stay a little while longer. The doctor comes in and gives us the talk about the procedure. I ask the doctor ""She is going to make it and come home"" they assured me this is a procedure done many times and to not worry. I kiss her forhead and tell her I'll see her home. It's 1:40pm and I can't take the car as I can't drive. To my horror uber is backed up and I'm wearing flip flops. I ask my brother for his shoes which are 1 1/2 sizes smaller and without socks and just start running.

Running in khaki pants, polo shirt, and tight shoes was a challenge but I must make it to that meeting. I finally arrive home, my computer is off. I turn it on, I join the zoom link (worst case I lie and say my camera doesn't work) and then wait. I look at the time, it's 2:07. I notice an email from the person I'm supposed to be meeting, they've been waiting for me before 2 and said I must always be early and that by 5 minutes they left. Shortly after reading this I find out my dog didn't make the surgery. 

It fucking sucks, I wasn't there for my dog's final moments and I didn't even make it to the meeting. I wish I had emailed to post-poned it or have done things differently. I also wish I never left my dog's side. 

Now I'm left with missing my dog, and blistered/cut feet which is still healing. What a way to end a shitty year.

TLDR: My dog bled and in the vet was okay. Couldn't drive so ran home to meet someone who was supposed to guide me for the future. Dog died and I missed the meeting. I miss my dog.",12
TIFU by eating a pot gummy contaminated in the dumbest way possible.,t2_vjysqzk,"Actually happened today.   


Backstory: A few months ago we had an issue with someone bringing laundry to our house for washing, knowing full well they were infested with bed bugs. We ended up treating the issue with a high heat option, where the house was heated up to 140 degrees and killed all the bugs and eggs. We were given a list of precautions to take and things to remove from the area before the heat was applied (think aerosols, candles, fire extinguishers, ammunition). 

Funnily enough, the precautions didn't include the removal of my infrequently accessed weed drawer, which contained a ten pack of gummies.  Fuck up #1. 

We found the issue several months later, and couldn't figure out what had happened because it had been awhile since the heat treatment and it wasn't at the front of our minds. We did eventually figure it out, and decided the gummy was still good, it was just going to be a more ""choose your own adventure"" thing where we guessed at how big a bit we wanted and hacked it off. 

Anyways, I asked my husband earlier if he would get the out gummy and chop me off a bit. He kindly obliged, and asked, ""What do you think this stuff is on the outside?""

I looked. ""Looks like crystallized sugar."" Shrug.

""Huh. maybe it's trichromes.""

Good enough. I popped it in my mouth and started to work it over. It had an odd texture which I wasn't surprised at, but it took me a minute more to figure out there was something INSIDE the gummy. I worked it out and showed it to my husband. ""Hon, was there a paper wrapper on those ones?""

He looks at it. ""I don't think so? That's really weird. What....?"" He trails off. ""I know what that was. That was a Silica Packet.""

It was. I fucked up by eating the silica packet packaged with my weed. Now I get to have dry mouth twice. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Our weed gummies got melted and hid from view a silica packet that I accidentally ingested. Never fear, I should be alright. The issue with those packets is more of a choking hazard than poisoning.",11
Tifu by trying to get my boyfriend a birthday gift,t2_4c2sngba,"(Sorry if formatting is weird, I'm on mobile)

Wow, so this just happened. I'm amazed at how stupid I really just was. Just wow. I have common sense a lot,  just not when I'm shopping at late hours.

So there are these ads that come up all the time saying that you can get a specific ""over stocked"" item for free just by filling out a few quick surveys! Well this item happened to be exactly what I'm getting my boyfriend for his birthday. I can't say what it is in this post because my boyfriend follows me, but the item is worth $300. So I thought, 'Sure why not try this?"" 

When you click on the link it's one of those where you need to complete a number of deals in order to get the big reward. I think a total of nine. The deals are things like: you have to download a game and get to level three, or you need to sign up for a free trial. 

I only got through about four when I thought ""wow I should cancel the subscriptions as I go, so that I don't forget and end up getting charged a bunch of money."" As I go back to the website it notifies me that the subscriptions need to be active for 72 hours in order for it to be valid. Well shit.

At this point I decide that it would be way too much work to go back and redo all of the subscriptions and that I'd rather just buy the item instead of going through the hassle. When I go to cancel the last subscription, it says I have to call in order to cancel. While trying to look for other options I see that what I have a free trial to is a $40 subscription. What?! Okay, so now I'm hoping that I can just call tomorrow  to cancel and it will all be fine. The reason I'm most worried is because I can't find the website from doing a simple google search which leads me to believe it might not be a real website. 

Tl;dr I saw that the thing I wanted to get my boyfriend would be free if I filled out some surveys, ended up possibly getting roped into paying $40",3
"TIFU by messaging a girl, things got spicy, had an accident.",t2_299hiyua,"This was about 5 weeks ago now, still want to cry every time I think about it.

So I have known this girl for about 2 years, let's call her Lindsey. So for a long time, me and Lindsey were into each other, but neither off us every expressed it or told the other person for a while. We were messaging, and just talking about general stuff when she brought up the topic of topless guys.

We went on talking about it, and she subtly hinted towards wanting to see me topless, so I was like alright and sent her a picture. She sent back a picture of her in her bra. A few more things went back and forth and she took off her bra. 

Obviously, like any man, seeing a girl without her bra on is bound to turn you on, so I started going at it. Things just kept getting spicier and spicier, lots of things were being shown. She said I'll be back in about 15 minutes, I need to have a shower, and sent me a whole ass nude before she went to leave me with.
Here's the fuck up.
I kept this picture on my screen, and got myself very close to nutting. I stopped myself and was like I've gotta wait til she gets back to finish. I didn't let go because I didn't want to lose the erection, so I just carried on slowly going at it.

I carried on choking the chicken, when I suddenly just came. She wasn't back yet, and I had just finished everywhere. She came back about 5 minutes later, and said ""now let's pick up where we left off yeah"". The embarrassment. The fear. As a man, I had lost all horniness in the one load, and was certainly not in the mood.

I had to say to this girl: ""so I may have nutted to you while you were in the shower, and now I don't really have the erection anymore you know""

We tried so hard to get it back. She sent more things,  I concentrated really hard to try and get it back, but to no avail. She was left unhappy, and I was left soft. 

TL;DR
Was messaging a girl some spicy stuff and she said she would be back soon. I nutted to a picture of her and she came back asking for more, only to be disappointed and I was left sad.",38
TIFU by trying to eat gummy bears while half asleep,t2_50l5b,"This happened last night. The putrid taste is still with me.

I take a sleeping medication and have a bad habit of eating while I’m half asleep. Well I had a bag of gummy bears next to my bed and groggily reached over to grab a few, forgetting that my friend was over the night before and had finished them off. So I’m fumbling around, find the bag, get myself a nice handful and stuff them into my mouth. At this point I bite down and it’s crunchy, and salty... my foggy brain takes another chew and after about 3 seconds realizes... CAT TREATS. I ate a huge handful of cat treats. I spit out what I could but they were stuck in my molars and I had to get up and brush my teeth for 10 minutes.

TL;DR: Thought cat treats were gummy bears and ate a bunch. Don’t eat food you can’t see folks.",21
TIFU by being excited to eat fruit,t2_5mhxbg2l,"Obligatory notification that I am on mobile 
Tw: mention of paedophiles 


So, this week I rescued a box of ugly fruit and veg. For those who don’t have ugly boxes, these are the fruit and veg that are perfectly edible but just look a little strange. In this box of ugly fruit were some pears. I know some people hate them, but I love pears! They have such a subtle flavour and taste really sweet when ripe. 

Anyway, the pears I rescued the other day aren’t ripe yet, which is perfect because I’m currently fasting, but they’ll be ready to eat when it’s time for me to break my fast. (I understand that some people don’t agree with fasting but it works for me) I’m not physically hungry, but psychologically the idea of food is sounding great, and I’m getting so psyched thinking about how great these pears are going to taste. 

In my emotional high of delicious pear infused thoughts, I added a line on my Instagram that was essentially “I ❤️ pears 🍐 “ 

Now whilst I internet, I’m not 100% up with all the lingo and who’s cancelled etc. which should be obvious as my sister just called me, informing me that I might want to take it down as it was essentially espousing my agreement with paedophilia??? Because the pear emoji is now a symbol of “pro expression, anti- reaction” nonces or some other such stupidity. I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 

So now I’m contemplating making a post saying something like “don’t agree with paedophiles, just really excited about fruit” or something similarly ridiculous in case people think I’m in support of child molesters

TLDR: rescued some ugly fruit, got excited about eating it, made a post about loving pears, found out it looked like I was supporting paedophiles

TIFU by watching porn as soon as my fiancé left the house for work.,t2_ijfej,"
So this actually DID happen today. And is super embarrassing for me. My fiancée had to get up for work today around eight thirty and I kept sleeping. I had woke up with a raging boner and extremely horny but knew there was no chance in trying to pull some before she left. So I accepted that I would wait until she left and put some porn on the iPhone and get it taken care of. I play sleepy, kiss her and tell her I love her, and wait for the door to close. And boom I’m instantly on a private browser searching for something. I find one within seconds and boom I hit play. It takes me to my site and starts playing quietly. So I turn the volume up and it’s still silently playing the “Stop jerking off alone” ad so I skip the ad and keep trying to get the volume up. It has a Bluetooth notch on it so I check my Apple Watch and it’s not playing there. Next I open my setting and sure enough my Bluetooth is playing in the car she’s sitting in waiting for it to warm up. She hasn’t said anything and I don’t think maybe the volume in the car was up or anything but man...

TL;DR I was horny and broadcast my porn to the car my fiancée is in

Edit:Sleep wasn’t the right thing to do. I will try to reply to everyone who commented. Thank you for the sympathy from all who sympathize.

Also changed fiancé to fiancée where I could lol",1013
"TIFU by reheating taco bell in my oven and nearly setting my apartment building ablaze, while blazed.",t2_16v5hb,"I finished work late and decided to pickup some taco bell on the way home because I am a garbage person and didn't want to cook.  I got stuck in traffic and it started to cool down, so I decided I would reheat it when I got home..  (hot garbage is best garbage)

I chucked it in a cold oven on the lowest setting and went outside for a jazz-cigarette. (hot garbage is even better when you're jazzed up)

I returned to an apartment smelling of delicious hot taco bell.

I excitedly opened the oven and flames and smoke erupted from it.

I immediately close the oven and turn it off.  I'm high.  My brains racing (as fast as it can) to solve this problem.

I fill up a water jug, open the oven, toss it in to douse the flames and shut the oven again.

The fire is now out, but now my apartment is filled with hot acidic smoke/steam.  Truly, hot garbage.

The building fire alarm turns starts.

Panic intensifies.  I'm about to have to explain (while high) to a firemen in front of all of my fellow residents how I'd just sent my taco bell on fire, but there is no fire anymore and everyone can go home.

I quickly open the windows, put my central heating on max fan to try to cycle some air out of my room and spend a quick minute hastily trying to clean up the evidence of my shameful mistake.

I start to head down the hallway with other residents, trying to play it cool like I don't know what's going on either.

MERCIFULLY the alarm stops before I make it to the elevator and I'm able to return to my now acrid apartment and deal with my mess in peace.  Fortunately my bedroom door was shut the whole time, so I only needed to wipe down every surface and mop the floor and leave the windows open all night.

TLDR: I tried to reheat taco bell in the oven, set fire to it, had to deal with the aftermath while high, and narrowly avoided any damage or embarrassment.

P.S. I think that one of the wrappers must have unwrapped in the heat and touched one of the elements.. I still can't work out how on earth a fire could have started otherwise, the food was barely warm.",18
"TIFU by Mistakenly going out in the cold, underdressed and without mask.",t2_7wtj9xnw,"I ordered pizza on Dominoes, but I didn’t pay online. I thought I could give the driver my aunt’s debit card when he delivers because I didn’t have enough cash. I was told to pay online, I was like nope. I’ve ordered pizza before. 

So, I went to the lobby with no mask (mistake one) and a hoody and sweatpants—nothing under (mistake 2). I thought It would be a minute transaction like usual. The man said he wasn’t going to take my card. I had to pay him online or give cash. I searched up Dominoes customer service, they told me to call my branch. My dumbass didn’t know it would be on my receipt. 

I ran out of the lobby, I forgot to get a mask and it was fucking cold. No jacket, no socks, no clothes except hoody and sweatpants. I was freezing. 

I ran crazily to the stores and Deli, they weren’t doing cash back even if I bought something. Then I entered the 4th deli and looked everybody was wearing a mask. And I touched my face—No Mask! Everybody even the cops and they were looking at me. Now, I got scared because I’m not eighteen, I have no mask, and that wasn’t my debit card, and this is NY. 

I just started rambling and telling my life story, God then The cop finally waved me over and let me go. And I asked the 4th store deli man for cash back. He said nope but there was an atm sort of thing in the back. He laughed and said, they were gonna take mad money from me. Now the cop was laughing and some man was laughing too. My phone internet stopped working when I went in and I didn’t know the debit pin.  Also, I wasn’t gonna be charged $3 or more to cash small money. I almost peed myself. Even the store wasn’t warm enough. 

I had to leave and go outside, looking for internet service and I asked someone for the Dominoes branch. They said look at my receipt. I got so mad. Called, Then the dominoes agent asked me for my zip code and I said 4 wrong zip codes. She kept on saying it wasn’t working, I kept looking around at the cop inside. I wasn’t tryna go to jail for debt card theft. Jail documentaries and movies really scared me. So, I searched google map for my address and got my zip code. Thank God for google map. 

Everything worked out but my uncle caught me outside when I was going home, with no mask, and I didn’t tell him I left his house. He wasn’t pleased. He just sent me home. Got yelled at, and we know when he tells my mom, she’s gonna finish my butt cuz she’s  an essential worker and all and she taught me better. 

So, now I’m home, in trouble and feeling slightly sick. I just hope that pizza is good, unless I’ll cry in the bathroom. 

TL;DR: went out without mask while under dressed to pay for pizza. Card was not accepted, found no cash back near me. got caught by uncle, got laughed at by cop, deli man, and random dude, almost peed my pants and froze to death.",15
TIFU by Having Virtually No Knowledge of Automobile Makes/Models,t2_343ya93,"It's 2004/05 and I'm in  middle school. It's the end of the day, and my fellow band students and I are rushing to the storage area to grab our musical instruments and hop on the bus. Secretly, I'm hoping to run into E, another tenor saxophonist in my grade, as I have a *massive* crush on him. That fleeting moment where we grab our saxophones and bid each other farewell is easily one of the highlights of my day. 

I race into the band storage room, and deflate a bit when I realize that there's only one sax in the cabinet - my cherished E has already come and gone! I grab my sax and then realize, with a twang of horror, that this is actually E's sax, and that he's accidentally taken mine. 

I'm awash with panic - for some reason, this is ""like, a really big deal!"". I rush out into the main band room, where my band teacher and the chorus teacher are chatting and getting ready to lock-up. I run over, and quickly explain the situation, and they ask me which number bus E usually rides. 

Now - I was always a bus rider - E, however, was not. His mother picked him up from school most days, and I had a habit of secretly watching him get into her car and drive off (Creepy much? I digress, middle school crushes are weird.). Anyway, I thought I had the info needed to sort the situation out, and in my panic, I made (what I later understood to be) one of the most embarrassing mistakes of my life. So... back to the story...

""What bus does E take?""

""E doesn't take the bus, his mom picks him up!""

""Oh, well... do you know what his mom's car looks like?""

""It's a white vulva!""

... 

At the time, I had no idea that ""Volvo"" was not the same word as ""vulva"". 

I must have said it 6 or 7 times over the course of my attempt to get this situation sorted out. How the teachers ever kept from bursting out laughing is beyond me - but I was painfully aware that there was an unusual lack of eye-contact throughout this entire exchange. I can't imagine how awkward it was from their perspective.

Anyway, E's mother had already driven off by the time we checked the parking lot. The kicker? I realize now, in hindsight, she actually drove a VW Jetta.

TL;DR: As a middle school kid I had no knowledge of auto makes, and repeatedly called a Volvo a ""vulva"".",9
TIFU by thinking someone would give away skins for free and having my account stolen,t2_4pkxpbd9,"
Two days ago, I couldn’t sleep, so I watched some Tiktoks on my phone and saw someone giving away cs:go skins on steam for free. I thought I’d give it a try and typed in the given link, leading to something that looked like Steam. I tried signing up, it went as usual, I verified my account on chrome. At least I thought so. As soon as I was done, I was logged off my own Steam account, someone changed e-mail, password and deleted my phone number. I tried recovering it, giving the support all necessary information to verify it’s my account. While waiting, I had a closer look at the website that looked like Steam. Someone faked it, even the address wasn’t real (he managed to cut away everything that made it obvious so that it looks exactly like the real page). Checking my mails more carefully, I noticed I didn’t verify me logging in earlier, but some russian guy. Luckily, Steam sent me his IP so I was able to DDos him with the help of my best friend. After 24 hours, the support gave me back my account.

TL;DR: I gave away account information, hoping to get free stuff, my account got stolen, I had to search proof it’s mine to get it back

TIFU by using a milk alternative for cereal,t2_5bjxopwx,"So this happened a couple months ago. I was craving fruit loops but to my horror and disappointment, we had no milk. I was in a very “fuck it” feeling and was acting kinda crazy to have fun with my friends. So I decided the next best thing to milk was orange juice. About five minutes in as I gobbled it down for shits and giggles to tell my friends and to finally eat my Froot Loops, the worst, most intense feeling of throwing up and stomach ache came about me. I ended up pouring the rest of the cereal in the sink and spent the rest of the night and the next couple days feeling like I had a rock in my stomach and a constant need to puke. 

Please never use orange juice as a substitute for milk....ever. I’m not sure how or why it affected me so much but never again. If someone has some nutritional or scientific explanation please let me know.

TL;DR : Used orange juice instead of milk for cereal, ended up with horrible stomach ache that lasted for a couple days",0
TIFU by ordering a burger for my boyfriend,t2_75rlcby1,"Hey, this is my first post here so I hope I don't mess up anything. 
So I (F19) was talking to my boyfriend (M19) on Instagram and he told me that he's home alone without any food. He lives pretty far from my place So I decided to order a burger for him. He asked me to drop the idea but I wanted to do something nice for him. I insisted he let me order his dinner. At first, he said no but then after some time, I convinced him. So I ordered him a burger and some chicken wings. I put his phone number so the delivery guy can call him directly once he's there. After 35 minutes the delivery guy called my boyfriend and told him he arrived at the location. Turned out the guy wasn't there and went to the wrong location. So now he was 30 minutes away from my boyfriend's house. My boyfriend asked me to cancel the order if I can and get my refund. 
I called the delivery guy myself and he was good for nothing. At last, I canceled my order and I couldn't get any refund. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the refund because I don't want him to feel bad about it. He was already hungry and I made him wait for 35 or 40 minutes for his order that he didn't even get. 
He ate a few cookies and then went to sleep. He has to be up early tomorrow and told me to not worry about it. 
It's not a big issue but he has been so nice to me lately and I was hoping I could do something nice as well without making a mess.

TL;DR - tried to order a burger for my boyfriend but the delivery guy was super later and mixed up the address. My boyfriend didn't get the food and went to sleep without any dinner.",7
TIFU by ruining my brother’s baby’s gender reveal,t2_13zyb7,"This actually happened on New Year’s Eve, two days ago. My brother and his wife had done the anatomy to find out what the gender of the baby was, and the results were given to their friends. The gender reveal was a throw back to their wedding, NYE one year ago, where there was a balloon drop at midnight. The only difference this time around, the balloon drop invitation was only for immediate family, was at 7:30pm, and the balloons were going to be either blue for a boy or pink for a girl. 

Since only immediately family was invited, and there needed to be a way for the reveal to be shared with other family and friends, a video was taken of the joyous occasion. So, with a soon to be grand father as the videographer, the gender reveal could begin. 

Everyone counted down, “3-2-1!” and my sister-in-law pulled the string to release the balloons. 

Black. 

The first balloons were black so as to hide the BLUE balloons that would follow so that nobody could peek through the opening of the balloon drop and know before anyone else. 

So, my dumb ass yells out “It’s black!” announcing the color of the balloons we first saw. I was excited! And my filter doesn’t always work, unfortunately. 

Now my brother and his wife have a video of them revealing the gender of their baby and the fucking uncle shouting “It’s black!” before anyone can shout “It’s a boy!” that they now have to share either their family because you just cannot recreate the surprise and expect it to be realistic. 

TL/DR: ruined my brother’s baby’s gender reveal by shouting “it’s black!!” in the video they are sharing with family and friends",161
Tifu by messaging my gf,t2_9mny3agi,"TIFU (M23) and decided today to create a Reddit account to share stuff with my gf (F25). I had a few drinks to work up some courage and decided to send her a message with some links to open up about doing some butt stuff. Now this isn’t the typical butt stuff but more along the lines of stuff guys don’t usually talk about and involves her wearing a harness and going to town on my back door. She had recently played with the area during sexy time and in a moment of vulnerability I decided to tell her I wanted to do more and sent some sub Reddit’s in addition to web links. 

I’ve been traveling for work and was hornier than usual thinking about our deeds and decided I needed to get out for a bit I left the hotel after sending the message to get some dinner and more drinks and decided to get my mind elsewhere for a bit. A couple hours had passed and I couldn’t get my mind off the message so I decided to check my messages and to my shock, I noticed I messed up her name and sent it to a random redditer! I’m not sure if they are active and will read the message but I might have accidentally got someone else screwed. Anyway, that’s how this became my throwaway account and made me reconsider messaging my girl about my new kink interest..

TLDR- messaged girlfriend about wanting to do butt stuff only to realize it was a random redditor.",38
TIFU by watching The Midnight Gospel after smoking weed,t2_232twqej,"Technically didn't happen today, but earlier this week, so almost. Not really intense, but I thought it was kinda funny and wanted to share. 

After the New Years Eve, my friend (17F) and I (17F) decided we want to have some fun so we put together a gravity bong and got high. Then, my friend said we should watch something and turned on the TV. She likes animation, so we browsed Netflix for a while and found this really colourful and interesting-looking show called ""The Midnight Gospel"". It's basically an animated podcast made by  Pendleton Ward (the guy behind ""Adventure Time"") and Duncan Trussell.

In the beginning it was really fun and the trip was going great. Until the 5th episode called ""Annihilation of Joy"". 

In a big summary, it was a never-ending loop of a guy trying to leave a prison cell, dying and then trying again, after a terrifying image of purgatory. 

That's when I knew we fucked up. 

The image was so awful and I could feel everything that was happening to the prisoner. The creatures and sounds in the background made me shiver so hard. But the loop aspect was the worst. I was so confused. The trip quickly went downhill. 

After some time we decided that it's best if we just go to sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

Had a not so good trip after watching an intense animated scene of purgatory and went to sleep.",7
TIFU by leaving my window open all day for several days.,t2_e0e29,"It’s Summer here in Australia, and it has been raining quite a bit. It hasn’t been overly hot and I’ve been enjoying the cool breeze through the window. Due to covid I’ve been spending a lot of time holed up in my room playing video games. 

Today I was happily watching TV and playing Pokèmon. I could hear my parents TV from the living room, so I decided to put my noise cancelling earphones in to block out a layer of noise. I grab them off my bed head and A THOUSAND FUCKING ANTS crawl out and all over my hands. 

Now, I’m a girl, and believe me I can scream. I *screamed* like I was being murdered which caused my dogs to start barking, and my mum rushed in, looking worried. She helped brush them all off onto my bed, and after some tidying and searching, we realised they were coming in through the window, probably because of the rain (worms have also infested our verandah due to all the rain). 

My dad is currently vacuuming and fumigating my room while I sit outside with the dogs. 

TL;DR: Don’t leave your windows open in Australia. There were no giant nopes this time round, but, you know, it’s Australia. They’re out there.",82
TIFU by accidentally baiting my dog to bite my nose,t2_35pjusfa,"So today I came down around midnight for a snack during studying, and I decide I’m going to fry a paratha. During this time, I decide to play with my dog, a yellow lab. He gets really excited and goes to our coat closet and picks out a glove. We call that closet his ‘browsing area’ because he only ever plays with the gloves and socks. I play with him a while, and then notice I have a nose bleed.

Here’s the fuck up:
I get a tissue and hold it to my nose, while sitting on the floor. My dog thinks I’m hiding a toy and very gently tries pry the tissue out of my grasp. I push him off, and think that’s all he’ll do. Boy was I wrong. This boi thinks it’s reasonable to literally leap at my face. He grabs the tissue and a mouthful of my nose, with bled even more. Needless to say, I stood up while holding my bloody tissue after that. The cherry on the cake? I burnt my paratha. 

TLDR: Baited my dog into leaping at my face whilst tending to my nosebleed, after playing with him.",3
TIFU by almost destroying a microwave and giving myself food poisoning.,t2_8m0r3ys4,"Oh boy here we go on a ride on my peak of stupidity last year.

So a little bit of background: im 16 and have been living with my girlfriend K's (15 we're both female) parents since everything went to hell and due to personal reasons not to be shared on this sub but i can definitely say I've loved it here K learned how to cook from her mom and i gotta say they make some of the best food I've ever tasted. (important for later) and since i workout with K and her dad (more often K since it's a hobby we share in the garage) im known to have a very big appetite.



This happened roughly august of last year and one day i went to the fridge to go grab a container of what's left of the curry from a few nights ago that I've been snacking on for the past few days and i was excited to get more of that delicious food down my mouth so i can go cuddle with K while having all that food digest.



And here comes the FU. So i put in the container (that wasn't a clear one) into the microwave and put the timer on for about 2 minutes or so which was a bad idea considering there was a decent amount of food left but i wanted the food as quickly as i thought i could get it done so after two minutes i go to the microwave take out the container open the lid and low and behold there was a spoon just chilling in the center of the food. 



I silently mutter (well fuck) quickly went to google for a moment and found out it was harmless in some scenarios which i just breathed a sigh of relief I went to go get a bite and already knew that the food tasted kinda chilly but i thought to myself ""hey I've eaten soup cold before what's the worst that could happen?"" and ate the ENTIRE container and thought nothing of it however at about 8 am i wake up needing to go to the bathroom because my stomach was killing me. 



K woke up a few hours later wondering where i went and heard me groaning on the other side of the door and asked me ""you alright in there OP?"" i tell her that my stomachs been in pain i felt nauseous and felt like a lowish grade fever kicked in 


K paused for a moment and said ""that sounds like food poisoning..What did you eat?"" i mentioned about the curry last night and she burst out in hysterical laughter telling me ""OP you should never really eat ANYTHING cold that comes out of the microwave"" 

K's mom was at the store and asked her to pick up some meds for me to help things settle down so im not in any pain throughout the day 


K just brought this back up so now im writing this red with embarrassment.

TIFU by making instant ramen,t2_3pcyl7if,"This happened years ago so the details are a bit foggy, bear with me. 

I was maybe 3-4 year old and I decided I wanted some ramen. I went and got a pack of Cup Noodles. 

First mistake: I accidentally somehow poked a hole in the bottom of the cup and all the water poured out but me being basically a toddler I didn’t really care. 

Second mistake: I put a styrofoam cup with uncooked noodles in a microwave, and set the timer for *10 hours*. 

You may be wondering where my parents were. Well they were right next to me, cleaning the kitchen and not really paying attention to their daughter. I know, irresponsible, but they learnt their lesson after this.

The ramen was cooking for I don’t know how long when the fire alarm went off, smoke was everywhere in the kitchen, my mother opened the microwave to find a black mass on fire. My little brain thought it looked like a brownie and I began reaching for it because.. it was a brownie.

My mom noticed and took me by the arm into another room where I watched as both my parents were freaking out, using bedsheets and opening windows to let the smoke out so I wouldn’t breathe it in. 

The fire died out after a while and I got a scolding for it. They still let me use the microwave after that incident, they just watched me a lot closer. 

Tl:dr: My parents let a toddler make instant ramen and they paid the price.",5
TIFU by wanting to have fun with my wife while I was in the bath,t2_1aeeao6f,"I was in the bath earlier today when my wife walked in to talk to me. She crouches by the side of the bath and asks if I want her to wash my back, I say yes please. 

She finishes washing my back and continues crouching by the bath and talks to me about... things. 

She is deep in conversation but all I can think about is splashing her with water. Here is where I fucked up: a contemplate the best way to splash her, I don't want to get her too soggy or she'll get angry so I decide to flick water at her... I stealthily move my hand down into the water and position my fingers to flick, I wait until she looks up at the bathroom window (obviously flicking someone with water is better if they aren't looking for some reason) and FLICK!!! My finger flicks straight into my right testicle! 

The pain! 

Wife is rolling around laughing. I'm rolling around in agony. 

We both regain our composure and she is still crouching beside the bath. I'm not sure if it was spite or something else that drove me to flick water at her but I quickly decide that she needs water in her face because she laughed at my suffering. FLICK!!! 

Straight into the top of my left testicle! 

TL;DR
TIFU by wanting to flick water at my wife. Result? Now I have sore nads.",172
"TIFU by deciding to try something new, unexpectedly ended up high, and my family just might kill me now",t2_3zij0xt8,"It's 3:41am now, but was 1:49am when I woke because of the smell.

This happened just a few hours ago and I'm dreading how bad it will be in the morning. It's probably going to end up as family-be-gone or some other equally horrible thing. 

Last night I got a notification that my package had finally arrived and it's something I've been very interested to have and use for a while. I get the mailbox key, and go pick it up. I get home, open it up and immediately I can smell a very strong odor that is definitely not a positive one, but I dismiss it and continue looking at everything that I've bought. It's a smudging set. So there is an abalone shell, a stand for the shell, two feathers, three crystals, a selenite wand, a palo santo stick, and a bundle of sage. (The sage is locally grown)

Each of these items by themselves don't have any kind of offensive odor to them. I've even tested some loose bits of the sage to make sure I won't hate the scent. I don't, it's not my favorite, but I certainly won't be too upset with it. Here's where tfu comes in.

A few hours pass and I decide to use this set, and like a giddy teenager, I'm not going to read to directions/guide that came with all these items. So at 10:30 I set everything up on my fire resistant cloth mat, and I grab a lighter. The palo santo stick is first and it's a pleasant smell, but definitely not one I really enjoy, it burns out very quickly and stops smoking very quickly as well. Next comes the sage. I'm trying to light the entire bottom, but the bundle keeps smoking a lot for a few seconds, and then the embers go out just as quickly. Obviously this means I need to do more. So I do.

I do this two more times while trying to get the entire bottom of the sage bundle to smoke. Then I realized that I never opened a window. I get up and open a window. This turns out to be perfect because now, attempt number 4, the entire bottom has burned and is giving off even more smoke and I'm sitting there feeling really great for my progress and that wasn't so hard after all. I've figured out the learning curve and this is amazing! I quickly put smoke in all four corners of the room and saw whatever comes to mind as I cleanse this space, all the while feeling better and better about this. Well, I feel so much better that I've decided to light it one more time just to just to ensure that I understand how to do this again. There is so much smoke, and I'm feeling really excited that there is so much because now I'll be able to use it for myself and not just the room.

I smudge myself and when I'm done the sage really starts to hit me, so now I'm feeling like I'm on top of the world. The amount of happiness I feel must be due to clearing out the negative energy in the room, right? WRONG!

At this point it's been 10 minutes, and my brother comes out of the office to ask what the smell is that's making him feel so nauseous. I'm still sitting on the floor feeling more and more positive as the moments pass. A few questions later, and I'm getting up to open all the windows I can, and the back door as well to try and air out the house.

 My job now done, so I decided to curl up with my kindle and read. Trouble is, I'm now high as a kite and calling my best friend that she needs to scone over and help me cleanse the rest of the house. While on the call, it hits me that I am not behaving normally, the thought keeps bugging me so I google it. Turns out that Salvia Sage can get you high for about half an hour. Then it gives you a sense of calm for quite a while afterwards.

2 hours later, after figuring this out and the smoke finally working its way upstairs, I'm getting other family members coming down to ask about the smell. I'm saying it's a new candle and I won't use it again.

3:37 as I post this and 45°F outside which is cold in Southern California. The window is open again I'm cold, and my stomach is cramping because of the smell. No one else is up yet.

TLDR: First time burning sage. I forgot to open a window and the smell woke me up by making my stomach cramp. The smell is in absolutely everything...",25
TIFU - Talking dirty to a guy when I was really horny,t2_5qix3tn2,"I f*cked up today by talking very dirty to one of my friends over text. This happened today. I was very horny while talking to a friend on snapchat. Me and my male friend were talking on snapchat when we were really horny, all of that ""I wanna have s3x with you"" and ""my kinks are _______"" stuff.

We are a fan of roleplaying and stuff so roleplaying while horny over texts was not a good idea. He likes rough s3x, I like bound s3x and being told what to do and stuff. So we were just sending texts like he does something then I do something like: Me: *takes all of my clothes off*. And then Him: I'm gonna f*ck you so good baby girl. And all of that stuff.

So we got into a roleplay where I was just sucking his d!ck, ramming his d!ck up my pu55y and s3xual stuff. All of this was my idea, I'll admit to that.

Then because I was complaining that my internet worked, my dad needed my phone. I didn't change accounts so he was still texting me, thinking I had my phone. Suddenly a message popped up from him. My dad ACCIDENTLY clicks on it and saw all of the s3xual stuff we have been sending and now he doesn't trust me.

Lesson learnt: always change accounts when talking s3xual and dirty to people.

TL; DR Talking to a friend all day, dad needed my phone and clicked in a text he sent me and saw the dirty ""I wanna have s3x with you"" texts and all of my kinks, now doesn't trust me.",5
TIFU and almost killed myself by getting cum in my eyes,t2_3wh4dyk5,"This happened 2 years ago but I just was telling this story to a friend today and thought to post it here. 

My bf and I were having sexy time and he finished on my face. Now, I don’t know if anyone else has had this experience, but whenever I get cum in my eyes, it is like every sperm is swimming to the back of my brain and my eyes instantly swell up, turn BRIGHT red and start burning like they are on fire. Well as soon as he finished and his cum drenched my eyelids I knew what was coming. I shut my eyes hard and peeled my fake eyelashes off and told him to lead me to the bathroom so I could try to rinse my face off before it started... seeping in. Once I was in the bathroom, he left to go get dressed. I really didn’t want to open my eyes because it would be ten times worse if I opened them without rinsing them first so I just kept them tightly shut and I was feeling around trying to find the faucet handle. I hit something with my arm and heard it fall, but assumed it was a bottle of lotion or something. 
The sink was filling up and just as I was about to stick my whole face in, my bf walks back in and grabs me and yanks me back and says something along the lines of “holy fuck I almost just killed my gf with my cum.” I’m very confused so I finally feel around for a towel to wipe my face off enough and open my eyes a crack to see that I had knocked my PLUGGED IN HAIRDRYER into the full sink and almost plunged my whole head in. I absolutely would have zapped myself, possibly to death. 

Now my bf tries to aim a little lower and I know not to ever leave the hair dryer plugged in. Had I died like that, it would have been pretty difficult for bf to explain what happened to the authorities... or my family! 

TLDR; blindly knocked a plugged in hair dryer into sink full of water and almost stuck my face in to wash the cum out of my eyes.",125
TIFU but thinking a coyote was a dog that needed rescuing....,t2_9hdh6uuf,"So mandatory not today. Was actually a couple years ago. Let me set the scene. I lived out on the country in a lake cabin with my then bf (now husband) and toddler. We had a beautiful pond right out the backdoor to the place with a little dock. Very lovely. 

So one day bf is working toddler is asleep and I'm reading a nice book just relaxing when out of no where I start hearing barking and growling. I peak out the back door (important to note I wear glasses and had recently broken my only pair so couldn't see well)  and saw 2 dogs. One was some sort of beagle or hound. the other I couldn't quite make out bc the other dog had it pinned down in the shallow of the pond. Barking and growling at it anytime it tried to get out of the water. 

My idiotic bleeding heart thought OMG that dog is going to kill that other dog so I thought I'll go out and make some noise and scare it off.i start off outside and begin to walk to where the dogs are but the closer I get the more I notice the dog in the water looks....off and very angry and aggressive. I'm about 5 feet away when the dog in the water attempted to lunge out of the water at me and that is when it hit me HOLY SHIT THAT'S A FUCKING COYOTE!!!! I had never actually seen a coyote before but my blood went cold in those 2 seconds I thought I was going to die! But the good beagle pupper jumped at the coyote properly backing it all the way up into the water again and I hightailed it back into the house! Called my bf and he sent his dad out to get them off the property. We've moved since this so I don't have to worry about that happening again but oh boy did I learn a lesson that day. 

TL;Dr
Dogs fighting in the shallow end of our pond I went out to stop them one turned out to be a coyote and the other one saved my life.

TIFU by placing the helmet on the fuel tank instead of wearing it on my head while driving a bike,t2_87953l8i,"So I was casually roaming and wandering the streets of the city where I live, enjoying the ambience and architecture of the city buildings, malls, villas and houses and feeling the glory of city lights during the night (I roam this way whenever I get bored).

I was wearing the helmet while I was driving on the main road and took it out and put it on the fuel tank whenever I entered a lane or a street. It was a few minutes before the incident I switched from the main road to the street that leads to my home. The street was empty with all the stores closed and the helmet was on the fuel tank guarded in between my hands holding the bike handle. I was about to make a left turn into a lane at the end of which I will reach my home. Since there were no people around I decided not to decelerate the bike and make the turn. And when I was tilting the bike handle towards left to make the turn the helmet was blocking the tilt and I was unable to make enough tilt to make the turn. With the slight tilt and the excess speed, the bike along with me got bumped into a wall across the street. I was left with few few injuries and bruises. The bottom-line is that do not put anything on the fuel tank while driving a bike.

TL;DR - Placed the helmet on the fuel tank while driving a bike and met with an accident.",0
TIFU by pointing out to my friend (F) that her date might* be gay,t2_5j92j9uf," My friend went on a date today and about an hour shared his pic with me. Lo and behold! Turns out, I know this guy. Not only are we acquainted but I think he might be gay. We have met a couple of times in various events and I once overheard him saying how being gay is really not accepted where he is from and ""it's difficult for us"". From his words, it seemed that he is gay (or bi). However, we aren't close enough for me to ask him this directly.

I told my friend about this and we spend about an hour with her recollecting the date and seeing if there were any signs. It does seem like she has a crush on this guy and the thought of this guy being gay was surely disappointing for her.

Worst thing, she can't even really ask him this directly right at the beginning and she doesn't want to make up a story to get it out of him. Neither does she want to go on for like 5-7 dates and then find out.

Quite a tough spot she has gotten into. If he isn't gay, then my bad for giving her a couple of sleepless nights. If he is, well, that's a while different can of worms.

TL;DR Told my friend that her date might be gay. She is disappointed.",3
Tifu by throwing up on my dog during a walk,t2_2t9w1hh3,"TIFU:Okay so this happened around 4 years ago, but I'm telling it now. So this story starts off with me getting back from the gym with my father. At this time I'm heavily into training and working out, so any kid at my age would try to stuff as much food in there mouth as possible, because eat big, get big right. So when I get back from the gym I made a protein shake with 3 cups of milk, 4 bananas, scope of whey and a hand full of almonds. So to any rational person that's to much food, but to a ego driven teen it was hardcore and cool. So later in the evening my dad said we have to walk the dog. So I get ready and I start walking the dog with my dad, but I also have the huge urge to throw up. Half way through the walk I can't handle the sickness so bend over and start throwing up off the sidewalk into a patch of tall grass. (Side note my dog is attached to a retractable leash). Then my runs under my nose and yeah I bet you know the rest. My dad ended calling stupid and a moron after I told him about what I consumed around 45 minutes earlier. I learned 2 things that day. Don't over stuff your self to the point of sickness and don't use retractable leash. TL;DR made a protein shake with to many ingredients. Went to walk the dog. Threw up on the dog. My dad got pissed",2
TIFU by trusting something you cannot see,t2_5lvplcf1,"This story happens during my childhood, I'm 32 now, I just remember it because I read a similar story here, so I would like to share mine. Hope you guys like it.

My dad work as a contractor, in his younger years he used to bring my mom on the road, and my mom used to pack some lunch for them to eat on the road, including a milky white thermos filled with hot coffee, nothing special, just some instant coffee, but he loved it.

Once upon, when they were on the road, they decided to take a break from the long drive, to have lunch, and maybe drink some of the coffee. They found a nice spot to park, under the shadow of a big tree, with a small creek with clear water nearby. My father parked his car, a personally modified Toyota FJ-40, he replaced its engine from a 3-speed gasoline engine, to 5-speed diesel engine he bought, it used to belong to small truck. It was a lovely car.

They washed their hands, sat on the front of the car, and took out the lunch. 3 boxes, one box full of rice, another filled with stir fried vegetables, and the last one  for meatballs and eggs. They put the lunch on a flat top cover of a self-made toolbox, it was located in a small gap in the middle, in between the front grill of the car and the bumper. The car was equipped with a flat bumper, so you can sit on top of it. Else, you could also eat standing by placing your dish on top of the flat surface of the front mudguard. It was a very lovely lunch, a nice tradition they enjoyed away from us kids.

After finishing their meal, my mom poured the coffee from the thermos to its cup, the first pour to her husband, as always. Then she took another cup, and poured one for herself. At that moment, right before she drank the coffee, one single cockroach floated up to the top of her coffee, dead, of course, most likely from the hot water.

From that point on, we brought portable stove and a jug of water on every trip. If you want coffee, you boil the water then and there. My father didn't trust that thermos anymore. He taught us that lesson. 

TL ; DR Don't put your hand into a hole, don't reach for the lamp in the darkness, don't peek on a peephole and never ever drink something out of a goddamn thermos, you never knew what went into it.",1
TIFU by skipping foreplay,t2_4s9snx7n,"So I (21 M) was getting down with my partner (20 F) for the last time before I head up country for work. Conscious of her parents in the room next to us we try to do it quickly and quietly. Everything's great a little tight but okay, we finish, all good. 

She shows me her hand and there's a little bit of blood on it. No biggie, she's recently come off her period, she runs to the bathroom. I start cleaning up and feel a bit... sore. I look down and see a bit of blood and notice that my banjo string has snapped. 

I've heard stories before how people don't notice and that it heals itself and all and all its not too bad. However, I start to feel a bit sick, light headed, worlds going dark, i stumble throug the house, almost tripping over a bag in the room bang on the bathroom door to be let in to vom.

Now I need to explain to my boss why I can't drive 5 hours up coutry without feeling like I'm gonna lose the contents of my stomach.

TL ; DR - skipped foreplay, ripped frenulum, now have to explain to my boss",11
TIFU by paying too much attention to my BFs shirt,t2_3g76z8ea,"This actually happened yesterday but it’s hilarious and I don’t really want to share with this with people I know IRL: 

My BF was away for a week to see his family (in our COVID19 safety bubble) for the holidays. We were laying in bed catching up and one thing led to another and I started going down on him. 

We were just starting out so he still had a shirt on. His shirt was Vault Boy from the video game FallOut giving a big thumbs up. Now, I have never played FallOut before but I know about it since it’s pretty popular. Unfortunately, I know enough about it that as I am giving him that sexy eye contact during the bj, I kind of notice the Vault Boy and the thumbs up. 

I guess i wanted to fit in with the Vault Boy cause my horny brain decided to give my BF a huge thumbs up while I’m deep throating his pole. When he looked at me all confused I decided to very confidently say: 

**I am the Vault Boy. I live underground**

Bless him he tried to keep a straight face cause I literally said that and started blowing him again. When I realized what I just said I laughed until I cried. I was still eatin dick tho and laughing crying and choking all at once. 

Needless to say we had to take a sexy time break and now he won’t stop telling me I’m his vault boy. 


TL;DR; got cock blocked by the vault boy from FallOut",26753
"TIFU by ignoring warnings from another tifu and getting scarred for life on another subreddit, as well as puking on my cat.",t2_8oajwri8,"Tldr at the bottom. This actually happened about 10 days ago. I was scrolling through Reddit, and I saw on my recommended posts “TIFU by trying to look for r/eyebleach”. I clicked on the post. Basically, the writer was looking for above subreddit and misspelled it as “eyeblech”. I was skeptical, so I checked and presto! It’s a real subreddit. Being a teenager, my curiosity got the better of me, and despite multiple warnings the author of the post gave, I clicked on it. I have never felt so sick in my life. After 2 minutes of scrolling, I was drinking soda, then landed on a particularly nasty one. I choked, then puked ALL OVER my cat that was sitting on my lap. He didn’t appreciate that, and was so startled he left 2 inches long scratches on my thigh. 
TLDR: didn’t listen to warnings about a subreddit and saw a picture of a leg missing most of the skin and muscle (visible bone) and puked over my cat, who proceeded to scratch up my legs. 

Edit: unless you have a strong stomach, do NOT check out the accidental link to the subreddit I put in. 

Edit 2: This is LITERALLY a warning. It’s rather disturbing how many people are like me and just click it anyway. At any rate, at least I’m not the only one... 

Edit 3: I removed the hotlink, hopefully the time it takes you to start looking for it is time enough to change your mind. Read the comments if you’re curious guys. 

Edit 4: This has actually become the most successful post I’ve ever made. It beat a post on my old account in 2019 of me getting superglue on my fingers and trying to cut it off with a knife. I still have the pictures. If enough people want the story, I’ll post it.",292
Tifu by tracking shit into my apartment.,t2_3vdao041,"Tifu; I took my garbage out and then came back inside and sat down. I was wearing my crocks (stylish i know). I sat down and started to smell a gross smell. Since i just took the garbage out i thought it was the can itself so i sprayed it with pine sol and cleaned it up. Sat back down could still smell it... oicked up my foot and smelled my shoes. Yep it was my left shoes had shit of some sort smeared in the crevices. I had walked all over my house and travked that stuff everywhere. So i quickly went to clean the floor now i can still get wiffs of it once in a while. Way of the road boys way of the road. Not sure why i have to write a novel to post about my fuck up 750 chracters is the length of some of the papers i wrote in school almost shit man. Cant a guy step in shit and tell everyone about it. As forrest gump says shit, it happens.

TIFU by getting a boner at my friend's party,t2_6i0jerk3,"My female best friend had her birthday today and I along with her boyfriend and his friends where invited. I was late to her party and all of the people were already present there, I was last to showup at her place. They had already cut the cake and she was excited that I showed up. She gave me a tight hug which gave me a fucking boner. I was nervous and got even worse when her boyfriend's friend noticed my fucking dick enlarging every second. That bastard added fuel to the fire when he told about my boner and it's cause to her boyfriend. The boyfriend got pissed and along with his friends embarrassed me and my best friend was kind of pissed off that I got boner because of a hug that she gave me. She claims that I ruined her mood and I was kicked out of her party, embarrassed in front of about 50 people. 

TL;DR : Got kicked out of my friend's party because I got a boner.",221
TIFU when my Mom called the cops on a break-in that never happened.,t2_672010fe,"
Hi guys, so this is my first post ever and I made a reddit account just for this subreddit. I actually listened to a Reddit podcast once so this is how I came to know about this community. English isn’t my first language so forgive me for any bad grammar/punctuation. Also this might get a little long but bear with me. This isn’t exactly recent, it happened almost two years ago. 

 Let me give you guys some background knowledge. We recently moved to a really nice area (I’d guess you can say it’s upper middle class/lower high class) that has a mix of farms on some areas and modern housing/stores in another. We moved to a newly built townhouse/neighborhood that was not even on the map yet. This townhouse was as big as a large single home with 3 large rooms, a basement and a two car garage (to use as a size reference for later on the story). Now this area being very family-oriented, there is basically little to no crime over here but it was still kind of close to a major city which is still iffy with their crime rate. Also please note that I’m a recently turned young adult who grew up with strict parents so I had to do some stupid things to get out of their grip. We moved and usually in our culture we throw a celebration inviting everyone we basically know. So I may be exaggerating or maybe not since I didn’t count each person, but that’s basically about 60-70 people with their screaming kids in one single TOWNHOUSE (this was months before COVID for the worried ones). The rooms were all full and some kids were even in my room (of course I was annoyed). I was the oldest of the family so I was basically in charge of making sure 30 something screaming demon spawn kids weren’t breaking anything or getting themselves hurt. This will tie into the story later.


So on with the story, my parents are strict and never really supported the idea of me having a boyfriend or hanging out with a guy friend until I graduate university (everything from under grad to grad, mind you) However, I did date a few guys back when I was a teen but I truly fell in love with someone about five years ago and it’s never been a different guy since. With him being my first love, I was willing to do anything for him, so of course being the oldest kid of strict parents I had no one to ask for help in the family for times I wanted to hangout with him. I usually had to resort to sneaking out during the middle of the night—past 2am or whenever my parents fell asleep or saying I’m with so and so or say I’m working.. before we moved. However with this new house, I was scared to try to sneak out since I haven’t done it before and wasn’t used to the ‘sounds’ of the house. To clarify, the AC sound or the floor squeaks (idk how to describe that) you’ll get whenever you walk or the sounds of the door knobs turning, etc. My mom is basically a ninja so she’s able to hear even the tiniest of sounds, so I HAD to take everything to account. It took me about a week of studying every sound at night and my family’s sleep schedule/antics to finally gather up my courage to sneak out. This was actually a last minute thing since I didn’t plan on doing it that specific day but my cousins had called me saying they’re at the karaoke bar with my boyfriend and told me to come. I really wanted to go since I never went to a karaoke bar with my boyfriend since he and I never really got to go out on dates with each other (we mostly drove around and had mini road trips late night). So I was super determined, I caked myself up,  wore comfortable but still stylish clothes and waited for my parents to head to their bedroom. I waited and waited until It was 12am and they FINALLY did, phew. However with my ninja of a mom, I had to make sure they were pre-occupied or asleep before I left. After waiting for another half hour, I heard my dad snore and I quietly opened my door. Since our house was newly built there were basically no sounds made but I made sure to wear socks since our living room and stairs were hardwood. A tip from an experienced house sneaker outter is to wear socks if you live in a house with hardwood flooring or else you’ll make sounds with every footstep when your skin sticks to the wood. The socks definitely did the trick and I made it to the basement in no time (I was tiptoeing slowly each step just to be extra quiet). Now the fun part was, how was I going to get out when it was a townhouse with basically only one exit that is quiet? Our garage was obviously way too loud to be an exit, and I wasn’t sure about the door yet since we barely used it (state law saying the road in front of our house is their road so we can’t park our cars). Well I didn’t prepare a whole week planning on my future late night adventures for nothing. I pretty much thought it was a brilliant idea to cut out the black mesh of window screen wide enough for me to get out. So yeah, my choice of escape was through the window. Also a little reminder that we lived NOT just in our tiny neighborhood road but the main road that our community uses. The front of our house was facing that main road—with a traffic light some distance away and behind the house (where the garage is facing) is where the neighborhood road is. I was nervous while getting out since I had bad anxiety, I kept pausing every single time but with a push of courage I finally got out and closed the window. I wasn’t able to close it fully to my dismay, but it was a few centimeters close. Now just when I stepped out, I could hear a damn creature hissing at me. I immediately froze on the spot and only then did I realize why some people freeze during times of fear. I shook myself and opened the window as fast as possible and jumped inside like some track star. I didn’t know then what that creature was but sometime later I found out it was a snake. I panicked as I thought my mom would hear the noise and I closed the window and hid in the storage room just in case. 

After waiting for about 10 more minutes she didn’t come down so I started planning again. I looked outside my window and saw that there was nothing there. I had to keep encouraging myself to open the window and step out. This time I wore boots just in case. I successfully stepped out as a car passed by and I prayed to God they didn’t think I was some burglar since I looked so suspicious coming out of a damn window at what’s basically now 1:30 am. Imagine seeing that while driving by, would that be creepy or would that be funny since I immediately went to the front door holding the house key for God knows what. I just wanted to prove I lived there by doing something stupid when the car already passed by. I sighed at my stupidity and walked to my car that I parked far away from my house to cover the engine sound. 
I went to the karaoke bar and had a bunch of fun and basically slept over my boyfriend’s house after. I left early morning at 7am before my family woke up. I used the front door this time, bringing in McDonald’s breakfast for them as an excuse of why I was awake so early. Luckily none of them heard me as they were sound asleep. I walked up to my room and slept for a while until I heard a loud knock on my door. I could hear my mom panicking and my Dad trying to calm her down saying “We’ll call the cops.” My mind blanked out when I heard this and i slowly opened the door. My Mom was asking me whether I went out and I said no, and my Dad replied asking if I invited any friends over late at night which I also denied, acting sleepy and confused. I felt super guilty and mega worried of what was going on. My Dad went on to say that someone broke into our house and I just stared. That couldn’t be possible or was it possible since I didn’t fully close our window. I went downstairs where my Mom was and sure enough the evidence of my stupidity was in plain sight. When I went back inside from the snake scare I must have gotten mulch all over the window sill and on the carpet floor. So with the black mesh being ripped and the mulch all over the window and onto the floor, it obviously looks like a break in. My Mom was saying how the burglar came in yet didn’t take anything valuable so it was so weird. By this point I’m killing myself over and over again my my head. I scrambled my thoughts and tried to calm myself as any kid who got caught by strict parents would usually do before saying something as our every word/action is dissected and analyzed by those hawk-like parents. I acted like I was confused and agreed with her and continued to walk upstairs to avoid any other confrontation that would expose my late night outing. I stayed in my room the whole time while my parents called the cops. I was thinking of all the ways the cops would be able to find evidences that it was me who opened that window. However I was never able to do anything since my parents were in the basement the whole time until the cop came. He examined everything and asked my parents a bunch of questions. The cop came again a day later and looked for fingerprints with a blue powder (I’m not informed of the specific name of it) and I knew I was f***ed. My safe neighborhood didn’t seem so safe now with this ‘break-in’ since my Dad texted everyone in their neighborhood group chat (yes, a whole group chat) so you can imagine how serious everyone is about their community and their living situation. The whole neighborhood was panicking and buying cameras to install, and everyone continued to ask us for updates. It was hectic and furthered my guilt. It took me about a week to finally come clean—with a lie. Yes, unfortunately I lied to cover up a lie, I’m disappointed in myself but what could my young self do. I’d probably get disowned if I had said the truth. I basically told my mom it was me who broke the black mesh but it was by accident from the time the kids stayed in the basement, I accidentally kicked the mesh and it had ripped. I’m known for breaking things btw. She was surprised and angry since I kept it to myself for so long, and I told her how could I when they had called the cops. I explained that I also did not know if it was actually a burglar since the mulch was there, but since my brother was playing soccer that day, it was probably from him since he tends to do that (I forgot to write this down on background info). My mom had said earlier that the mulch could be from my brother but she wasn’t sure since the black mesh was ripped. 

After I admitted this she was both relieved and super angry which I totally understand. But of course like any strict and ninja-like parent how could my lie sound 100% convincing? I’m sure she has some doubt in her mind, but at least with me admitting it she knows now it had to do with me and not some random person. 
So this is basically my story of how my Mom called the cops of a break-in that never really happened. Thank you for tuning in, and sorry if it was long, I really have a habit of adding extra unneeded info a lot. 

P.s Months later my brother cracked the window with just a slight punch to it. This made my parents think the windows are indeed easy to break so I think it helped my case a little bit now.


TL;DR

Strict parents so I snuck out through the window, it was possible with mesh I ripped. 
Mom sees the mess and the ripped mesh the next morning, so she calls the cops thinking it was a break-in.
The cop came and examined for fingerprints that undoubtedly had mine all over it. 
Neighbors all panicked since it was a new neighborhood that was just built a few months prior, and it was an extremely safe area. 
I admitted later on it was me but with an embellished lie. I got off with basically no consequences except for another fuel to deepen my anxiety.",20
"TIFU by snapping my dick during sex...on you guessed it, New Year's Eve 2020",t2_3qa92gp2,"happened on the last day of 2020. 

  fuck 2020, right? well. fucking my way into 2021 did not fare well for me...

  my on-again off-again gal sent me a text the day before seeing what was up and we agreed to shack up in lieu of all things 2020, and of course the New Year approaching. it didn't take long before we got into the sex stuff...me on top, her on bottom as usual. for context, i cannot stress the on-again off-again thing enough - we've been together (kinda) for 2.5 years, break up about as often as the wind blows (almost not kidding), and i haven't been with anyone nor has she (afaik) in this time. well, to put it plainly, sex and cuddles are the only thing we do 'right.'  i cannot stress this enough - i'm a tall dude and she's a petite gal. it's fun. we cuddle and do the lovey-dovey stuff pretty awesome as well. other than that, we suck.

  while i'm off track, lemme backtrack a sec; a little over a year and a half ago i got sober/clean. she was instrumental in this process to say the least. i never in a million years would've considered sobering up...not even after my dwi early last spring and then getting out of jail, freaking out and booking a one-way ticket to LA. i called her up, we talked, she told me to come home, i did. i was in LA 16 hours. to stay on topic (sex stuff), my health was so bad pre-sobriety...really bad, but my will to keep doing sex stuff was greater. on two different occasions during this period i was injured during sex stuff as well: 

  - passing out after sex stuff walking to the kitchen to get some water - [mild concussion/8 stitches] (https://i.imgur.com/wygy3RJ.jpg)
  - and much more serious...a micro aneurysm

yeah kids, don't do drugs. 

  so, back on track; i was on top, she was on bottom. her finishing move is getting on top of me so i hopped off and laid on my back and she got on...it took about 15 seconds of the hard riding then....

  **pop**

 she felt it, i felt it (of course), but what's really funny is that we both finished right after. no idea how i pulled that one off considering my dick just snapped. and, i never come out of her since she's so small - can't really explain why it happened. but, yeah...poor little guy is pretty sore and bruised so terrifyingly bad (pic below this post) - meet with the urologist on Monday, and one last time...

  fuck 2020 - no thanks for the covid and the broken wang, you fucker.

tl;dr: broke my dick fucking on the last fucking day of fucking 2020. fuck 2020.",18
TIFU by having an internal monologue with myself while trying to sleep,t2_68sxk5q8,"Obligatory it happened a few months ago. I was trying to sleep but I just kept talking to myself while covering myself in sheets, I always have a small internal monologue with myself before I sleep, but this time the monologue somehow got to the topic of friends... I hadn't really seen or contacted any friends since lock down... So somehow how one conversation lead to another and I was just slowly remembering all of my insecurities one after the other, it was bad I felt tired but couldn't sleep, my heartbeat was very fast, I felt nauseated, I cried and then eventually it was 4 am in the morning and I hadn't slept a wink, I decided trying to sleep at this point was useless so I was awake and did the next 7.5 hours of classes starting from 11 am - 7 pm finally slept at 8 pm and after that my sleep schedule was utterly fucked for a week

TLDR: I was trying to sleep, got reminded of insecurities, couldn't sleep, got very tired and fucked over my sleep schedule for a week",11
TIFU by helping my students focus their microscopes without realizing I needed an eye exam,t2_72cnmt2k,"By ""today"" I of course mean a few years ago. I was a teaching assistant for a college biology course and one of the lab sections involved looking at slides under a microscope. It's surprisingly hard to find the right focal plane through a compound microscope if you've never used one before, so I showed several students how to.

Now, these are the sort of microscope that have two eyepieces that can be focused separately, so if your eyes have different prescriptions you can still have a good binocular image. I did this myself for a few of the microscopes and basically said ""okay, you should be good to go with this one"" to the students.

A couple months after that course ended, I was (for some reason) talking about eyesight with a friend. I've never worn glasses; AFAIK have never needed them. My friend jokingly asks me to cover one eye and read a sign across the room. I did and...couldn't read the sign at all with my right eye. Turns out I've had an astigmatism most of my life and never realized it because my left eye is fine and compensated for the right eye. So when I was ""helping"" my students focus each microscope eyepiece separately, I was just badly screwing up their view through the microscope! It never came up on my teaching evaluations, so hopefully I didn't lead them too far astray.

TL;DR I didn't know I had an astigmatism, so when I helped my students focus their microscope eyepieces separately, I was actually messing it up for them.",98
TIFU by looking around a bit too much in my moms room,t2_493oupjc,"So this didn't happen today, but around the summertime, so think around July. There is a few things that I should explain, I am a male, but not exactly the straightest cookie, but I can't find the best thing for what I feel. I should also mention that I am insanely curious, but also at that age where people become extremely horny, (this will become sort of important later), I should also say that my mom is one of those people who are tough, yet you somehow can't stay mad at. I was also looking for a Halloween ""costume"" to wear, although I would also use it for a story I was writing as sort of a basis for event.

With all of that out of the way, I had been going around the house, looking for things to create this costume I wanted, I went through all the boxes and things to go to thrift store, there I found a top for what I needed. Now all I needed was a bottom, but referring to the curious part of the above, I decided to go into my moms room, I knew that there was a few things there that I would be needing, now I should say that none of the stuff I took was worn all that much due to the pandemic, so I got some leggings and shoes from the closet, I decided to snoop around a bit more, and at some point came to the drawer right next to my moms bed. Now I should say, that this drawer, I though contained a flashlight and some other emergency equipment, I had seen it open before when I was younger. I opened the drawer, not expecting much, and right there, I saw a butt plug, I could have guessed that some of the fabric had parted to expose it, but there it was. I stupidly decided to open it further, and Bam!, there was a dildo, right on top of some of the fabrics, that would turn out to be some, well very exposing clothes. I then decided it would be a good idea to dig further, I found a vibrator, and tons of lube, some of it had leaked, it was a slippery, gooey mess, and then there was a paddle with the text of ""Attitude Adjuster!"", I had seen this before in the time when I was younger. So you want to know what I decide to do, not close it and back away, but take it away to my room to experiment with them. I didn't ever do anything with them, and eventually returned them, but I would occasionally get really horny and want to get that dick back out for some more play. Oh wait, there was also some handcuffs that I took for the costume to go around my wrist, just both on one, but thats not exactly important. But this just sort of ruined my image of my mom, I couldn't just look at her the same knowing that she may have played around with this stiff, slimy dick in her younger years, and possibly now. The thought of her kinky times always just scared me, but I never expected that she would have these sort of things.

TL;DR: I went around looking for some cross dressing costume, and found my moms kinky toys

Edit: I just want to clear things up, I never used them, considered it, but never actually did it, also I made damn sure to take pictures of the scene to make sure I put them back where they were, so I really dont want my mom to find out, the handcuffs were at the back and there has been no suspicion, I am currently considering to return them, but I haven't gotten a chance yet.",3
TIFU by insulting a former member of my favorite band,t2_15c3ux29,"This was in February, but I thought you all might enjoy. 

The lead singer of my favorite band posted on Facebook that his former guitarist was going solo and he was wishing him luck. Not thinking that anyone from the band would see my comment and hoping that a fan would reply to my comment, the following took place:

Me: “At the risk of looking like a moron, I need to ask...I’ve been to 40+ shows and I’ve never seen this man. What am I missing?

Former Guitarist: “Somewhere in there, you must have missed all the shows in 2016 and 2017. I’m also pretty skinny, so, I may have just been turned sideways.”

Funny enough, those were the only two years I didn’t attend shows. Guy must think I’m a total bitch. 🤦🏻‍♀️ 
Usually whenever the band posts on Facebook it gets several hundred comments, but just my luck there were only 137 this time.

TL;DR:

TIFU by saving a mole from getting hit by a car,t2_1c8sprzp,"Of course, this was a while ago during the summer.

I work overnights doing refrigeration work for Kroger’s and such. One night on my lunch I was sitting outside, and this mole came up to me and nibbled on my boot.

The mole then heard a car passing, and freaked out; running directly towards the car. For some reason I had to stop it. So I waved down the car and told him to stop. Without even thinking, I picked up the mole to carry it into the grass. Well, we got to the grass, then the mole bit me.

APPARENTLY moles have diseases, and my mother asked me to go to the doctor to get it checked out. 
I got to the ER, and waited for an hour. Once I went in to see the doctor, he looked at my finger and told me it was fine, and sent me away.

$300 later, I’m mole disease free.

TLDR: saved a moles life and it charged me $300 for helping.",32
TIFU by lying to a bunch of strangers,t2_8x373i8v,"Yes, it’s a throwaway. This has been going on for a while, but it’s starting to get to me and I don’t know what to do. I’m not even really sure where to start to explain it. I can’t get into a lot of details, because certain things I’ve said might give me away.

A number of years ago, I quit drinking. Started going to meetings, doing everything right, blah blah blah. Things were going pretty well. One day I relapsed. And I don’t just mean had a drink and had to start over…I was working as a pizza delivery driver and I got in an accident because I had a thermal mug of Jack and Coke in the car with me while I was working.

That’s a bad enough fuckup, but that’s not why I am posting. A few months back, I discovered a sub with people who either don’t drink anymore or are trying to quit. Great for me, I’ve been there. But not only have I been claiming the day that I originally stopped drinking, but last night I was sitting there with a Red Stripe in my hand, telling somebody with a couple weeks how much better it gets.

I don’t know how to fess up. I don’t know if I should. I mean, a lot of people are getting encouragement from the things I’m saying, and I know that the things I’m saying are right. But I feel like a fraud.

TL;DR - claiming to be something I’m not, can’t figure out how to fix it.",1
TIFU by crashing a funeral,t2_601mhvj4,"A guy I work withs wife recently passed away. We aren’t super close but I do come into contact with him somewhat regularly and he has always been a very nice guy. I find out the funeral is today and decide to go with my wife. His wife was well liked and popular in the community so we knew the funeral would be very crowded. We have several high risk family members so we decide not to attend the actual service because of COVID so our plan was to wait in the parking lot for the service to end and just pull into the line of cars heading to the burial site. There we can catch him outside say we are sorry and go on with our day.

Everything was going great until the service ended. Everyone comes out. They put the casket in the car and suddenly everything starts to go very wrong. No one is lining up behind the hearse.... weird... suddenly a few minutes later the hearse drives off with no one behind it. No police escort nothing. So I pull out and start to follow it from a distance. It’s not going to the burial site it’s going somewhere else. So my wife gets on the funeral home website and confirms that the burial is taking place today and also confirms the address of the burial site. So we decide to drive by the burial site and see what’s going on there. We reach the burial site and a tent is set up chairs set out and everything. The burial is definitely happening today. 

We decide to go back to the church. When we get there everyone has left. Dang it. We’re very confused but we know the burial is happening today so we decide to go back to the burial site and just wait there to see what happens. 

When we finally get there the procession is just pulling in. The hearse is there cars lined up everything. Whew idk what happened but at least we made it. We pull in behind the last car and start to walk up to the funeral. Suddenly I reach the tent and a few people standing around it and realize I know no one there. About 80% of the people there are Hispanic. This guy is white and so is his whole family. I frantically look around for anyone I know and find no one. A crushing wave of realization dawns on me that we’re at the wrong funeral. I break the news to my wife. WHAT?! She exclaimed under her breath. Yeah we’re definitely at the wrong funeral I tell her. People are starting to look at us a little strange. This funeral is also a lot smaller than the one I was expecting to attend. We gotta get out of here she tells me. It’s too late now i reply it’s gonna start any second. We frantically talk bank and forth for a second and decide we should leave. We turn around and walk as quickly and quietly as we can back to our car and go back home to sulk in our shame. 

We eventually called the funeral home and found out after the fact that the burial was moved to another day and they didn’t have time to update their website.

TL;DR I didn’t realize the funeral I was trying to attend and been moved to a different date and accidentally crashed another funeral at the same location leading to massive embarrassment.",30

TIFU by breaking a glass on my brothers birthday

It was my brother's birthday, and we were sitting down to eat a pecan pie that my mother had made the day before. I began emptying the dishwasher to get some plates, and decided to put the rest of them away since I had some time. As I was putting away a glass measuring cup, I dropped it on the countertop and it shattered. As redditors who have broken glass may know, it goes EVERYWHERE. 

That wasn't even the worst part. Then I realized what I had broken it near. The pecan pie. We couldn't eat it because it had big glass chunks on it, meaning that little pieces we couldn't see would be on there too. So not only did I break an important glass measuring cup, I ruined the birthday breakfast for my brother, and I had to spend the next several hours cleaning it up and vacuuming everything.

TL;DR: I ruined my brothers pecan pie for his birthday that my mom had spent many hours making by dropping a glass near it.",1
TIFU by getting banned from Habbo for over 20 years.,t2_3vccmfrz,"So I've seen a post going around Reddit recently about a guy who got banned from Yahoo Chess, and it reminded me of something that once happened to me. Obligatory this happened ages ago, probably about 8 or 9 years ago to be precise.

When I was around 16, my girlfriend at the time told me that she never played Habbo (or Habbo Hotel) when she was a kid. This shocked me, as all my friends and I used to wile away countless hours on that game, so I resolved to show her what she was missing out on. We both made accounts (I couldn't remember my old account from when I was a kid), and jumped into the game, both sitting in our own houses. Here's where the FU happened. I made the mistake of asking my girlfriend, using the in-game chat, if she wanted to hang out on the weekend in real life. Apparently, they don't take too kindly to people asking that question in a game made for children. A few minutes later I was kicked out of my account, and a message popped up telling me I was banned for, if memory serves, 21 years. On top of all of that, my girlfriend didn't even like the game.

TL;DR - Asked my gf if she wanted to meet up irl while playing Habbo, got banned because they thought I was trying to prey on children.",34
TIFU by accidentally skipping in line at a Subway,t2_l15qs,"Today I was threatened in a Subway so I guess you could say 2021 is off to a good start.

As I walked in there was a woman standing outside and as I walked past her she told me she was waiting on an order. I think to myself ""Okay, cool."" and walk past her into said Subway. There is a customer inside that is clearly 6 feet away from the door as I enter, further confirming that this woman is not in line. As the customer finished their order and as I begin mine, said woman bursts in and howls ""Is she really ordering!?"" to which I, perplexed and wondering why this woman was acting like I had just kicked her dog, respond ""yes...?"". Enraged at this injustice, she shifts attention away from me and barks at the person behind the counter, demanding that they confirm she was in front of me, to which the poor employee responds by staring in bewilderment and awe.

I explain that it's a misunderstanding since I thought she'd said she was waiting for an order, not waiting to order, and I insist she orders first. Me being the unreasonable person I am, was expecting her to acknowledge this and go about business, like a normal person. Boy, was I wrong.

She responds by yelling ""Don't f\*\*\*\*\*\* tell me what to do! I swear to god I will seriously....!!(??)"". I did not want to die today so I did not inquire about what she would do. I've apparently already done the worst possible thing that anyone has ever done to her by trying to spitefully, and ""knowingly"" order food ahead of her. This woman had nothing left to lose. She continues on about how I have a problem with her. I insist there is no problem. As she continues to spew I, again, ask her to please order and she responds ""I WILL!"". Thank god.

As she finishes her order on the other side of the room I can hear her yelling at the unfortunate virtual bystander she's FaceTiming with about how rude I am and I would have reacted the same exact way if I were in her shoes (her very reasonable reaction). Yes, this entire time she has had earbuds in and is FaceTiming with someone and bellowing at them (in between ordering), demanding confirmation that they heard our conversation as I walked in and that I KNEW I was ahead of her and something about how I need to be okay with having her way or something equally sensical. I have to believe this innocent lackey agreed with her out of pure fear of becoming her next victim. She then made her exit.

Yes, me and my sandwich are safe.

People are wild.

TIFU by giving a client the wrong cremated pet,t2_a59qca2,"Now this happened a few months ago... I work in a vet clinic that offers cremation services for euthanized pets. When a pet comes back from the cremation facility, we will create a custom tag for the pet with the owners name, and if everything that needs to be packaged up has been accounted for that gets attached to the bag directly. Generally I do these one at a time, so the process goes &gt; print label &gt; put urn with paw print in fancy bag &gt; call owner to let them know remains are ready &gt; make note on label that owner had been contacted. I had two this day and left a message for the first owner to let them know their pet had returned, and got the second label ready for the next one. When I was getting things ready, the first owner called and said she would be by soon to pickup, so I took the label off and made a note. I can’t remember exactly what happened but SOMEHOW when I put the label back on I attached it to the wrong pet. I’m normally much more careful but for some reason this day I missed it. The owner came to pick up and goes on her way. My coworker answers the phone awhile later... and it’s the owner letting us know this is not her pet. The urns come with name plates and the one she had with the remains said “Buddy” instead of “Chloe”. I was MORTIFIED. I thought for sure I was going to get fired. Thankfully the owner was VERY understanding and patient and my manager was cool about it because she had done the same thing a few years prior. Needless to say, I’ve been very careful since then.


TL;DR: I gave an owner the wrong cremated pet because I wasn’t paying attention",10
TIFU by giving my husband his birthday gift with a full stomach.,t2_2cbeyxla,"This actually happened just after midnight this morning:

Every year my husband asks for a blowie for his birthday, which is totally fine and fun. His birthday was on the 30th but we have four kids including a 3 month old so sexy time just happens wherever we can fit it in ;)

Last night we ate way to much food and watched movies until all the kids were sleeping and the  decided to head to bed ourselves. I popped a tums because my stomach was unsettled (this is where I should have known I was making a bad choice tbh)

Things start getting steamy and I decided to let my husband hold my hair for added sexiness. I don't normally let him hold my hair and control the pace because I have a horrendous gag reflex. So as we continue on he's super into it and I keep having to back off to avoid gagging...

And then he grabbed my head and finished into my mouth.. At the exact same moment he came...I threw up into my mouth. So in a panic with penis, semen and vomit in my mouth, I just swallowed it and practically flung myself off him coughing and gagging. When he asked if I was okay, I explained what happened and apparently he didn't notice. But I noticed...and still have a stomach ache 10 hours later.

TL;DR: tried to give my husband a sexy birthday surprise and instead of just swallowing what I was planning on I also swallowed vomit and gave myself a stomachache.",108
TIFU by trying helping my grandma use the TV remote... and scalding my crotch in the process.,t2_98dlodu4,"TIFU (earlier this evening) when I (28M) got up off the armchair in order to help my grandma operate the TV remote. She couldn’t find the volume controls and trying to explain across the room wasn’t working - so I got up to show her instead. 

The catch? 

Moments before I had been handed a hot cup of tea, and somehow my dumb brain had already disregarded this information. 

It took me a second to realise what was wrong but when I did, I let out a pretty good shriek. Almost the entire mug emptied directly onto my crotch/lap, also dousing the almost brand new furniture where I was sitting. I probably couldn’t have aimed it any better if I’d tried. Direct hit.

Moments later my parents rushed downstairs to help, my grandma was confused (later found out at first she thought I was just goofing off), and I was still trying to process what had just happened. 

After briefly trying to help mop up the tea from the chair, I went upstairs to inspect the damage that I’d inflicted on myself. 

My thighs had turned a nice pink colour, and I felt very uncomfortable but I couldn’t see any blistering and thankfully my genitals seemed to be relatively unscathed. 

One cold bath later and I’m now sat on the couch that didn’t get flooded, feeling sore and annoyed, but relieved it wasn’t much worse. 
 
TL;DR: spilled almost an entire cup of tea onto my crotch while getting up from a brand new armchair to try and help my grandma with the TV remote. 0/10, would not recommend.

TIFU by accidentally propositioning a friend to a threesome,t2_5jqhm4c8,"My boyfriend and his brother are very close in age and therefore we tend to hang out often. My Boyfriend and I have always really liked one of his brother’s ex flings. We were both extremely disappointed when it ended, especially because the problem was he didn’t want to commit to her. My BF and I often joke around about keeping her instead of the brother and just how much we love her. We often jokingly talk about how we should be a throuple. 

The other day I was hanging out with this girl and another friend and I casually/ jokingly brought up how much my BF and I liked her and how we wanted to have a throuple with her. Except instead of saying throuple I said threesome. Both my friends were giving me shocked expressions before I realized what I said. It got a bit awkward after that. 

Anyway my boyfriend was quite amused that I accidentally asked for a threesome. Whoops!

TL;DR Accidentally asked my Boyfriend’s Brother’s Ex to have a threesome when I meant to use the word throuple. Awkwardness ensued.",437
TIFU by releasing a rattlesnake in our apartment,t2_4a5504le,"So my bf and I are asleep in bed in the middle of the night (3am to be exact) and we wake up to this particular noise. I had no fucking idea what the noise was, and being half asleep I was even more confused. Then my bf points out that it sounds like a rattlesnake. After he said this I was freaking out, because holy shit it sounded exactly like a rattlesnake and there was nothing else I could think of that could make this noise. It happened again 5 mins later.

After a while of my bf convincing me that there are no rattlesnakes in Canada and that it was probably the furnace making that noise ~it most definitely wasn’t the furnace~ I somehow fell asleep and did not hear the noise again.

The next day, at 3 pm we hear the noise again. And then again 5 mins later. No rattlesnake in sight. Wtf is happening. Then later, I open up my iPad, and I see notifications that I missed taking my vitamins at 3pm. Here is where I fucked up.

I had downloaded this app the other day on my iPad, called MediSafe, to remind me to take my vitamins everyday. I chose 3pm. Apparently by accident, I set one of them to 3am instead of 3pm. You know how this app decides to notify you? It makes the sound of pills shaking in a bottle, which sounds like a fucking rattlesnake when you’re half asleep at 3am.

TLDR: downloaded an app that has notifications that sound like a rattlesnake. Notifications went off multiple times before I realized wtf was happening.",58
TIFU by draining water with my shoelaces in it,t2_5ar1umn2,"i'm sad and dumb as heck but i feel like telling it lol.

so on friday is my cousin's wedding. just a civil wedding, we're not attending the main ceremony except for my mom since she's a special guest. only in reception which the thing is we all (me, my brother, and dad) don't want to go since covid but my mom is mad as heck plus a terror woman because she said it would be shameful not to go to. i know that my country has a limited number of people who can gather which is below 10 but i doubt the reception to only have that amount of people. she said that we can stay in the car after eating. god, i hate her for that, and also probably the reason why my shoelaces has gone through the drainage. 

back to the main story, she told me to find some shoes to prepare even if the wedding is a week away. i found all of my (rubber) shoes and shown her everything. i'm already exhausted because she kept asking me about it last night, now i still gotta clean the house and scrub/dust off my selected shoes for the wedding. the shoes that i chose are not expensive, pretty much just the cheapest mall rubber shoes that i used for my school (before covid). both were dusty so i cleaned them by scrubbing the plain black clothing and the veeeeery dirty white sides (I don't know what they were called lol). both shoes were done. now, with the laces which i don't want to wash at first since they seemed kinda clean already but they're just laces, easy to clean so why not. i scrubbed them both quickly and washed them with the same water. now here comes the dumb part. as i was draining the water, i dumbly pour it all with my the thin laces in it, directly through the big and wide open drainage. i was just staring with mouth open. what the heck did i just do?! i tried to stuck my fingers inside but realised it's already gone. it just easily and smoothly drained.

i was still shook as heck and my eyes were teary bc what the heck. i wanted to tell my parents but i remembered i was in a bad mood and i know they'll just scream at me for being dumb. i tried to just be quiet and find for my another pair of laces. gladly, i found another one but I can't just let go of the feeling that they just freakingly drained so smooth. like what the heck. my head aches so bad. i gotta sleep lol.

+ also maybe you're wondering, can't i just get them or open the pipes to get the laces? well no, the drainage is cemented and is directed thru the sewages,,,,, so, swim free my shoelaces. 

tl;dr : i washed my pair of shoes that i have to wear for an occasion. without knowingly, when i finished washing my shoelaces, i accidentally poured the dirty water with the laces in it thru the damn drainage. i'm so dumb.",4
TIFU by sending a Live Photo,t2_2oixmf2j,"TIFU by sending a picture to a friend with an iPhone and taking a Live Photo. 
For those unfamiliar, iPhones take “Live Photos” which capture like 3 seconds of video for some god forsaken reason. 

I was taking a picture of my laptop screen to show the zoom meeting I was about to attend - the friend had purchased a New Year’s Tarot reading for me. What I didn’t realize was that my husband was in the background loudly commenting about my dog’s “fucking gigantic penis”. (A separate story...)

The friend sent me back “LOL PLAY THE LIVE WITH SOUND ON” and I had no idea what she meant. She then told me to watch the Live Photo with the sound on. Lo and behold my husband is essentially shouting “fucking gigantic penis” in the background. 

Sigh. 

TL;DR TIFU by unknowingly sending a three second sound bite of my husband shouting about my dog’s penis to a friend

EDIT: The story about my dog’s gigantic 

I took this video of the dog laying upside down with his teeth all hanging out and put a “good morning” filter on it and put it on Snapchat. Like 10 people had already seen it and then my husband was like “you didn’t see his gigantic fucking penis!?” And then I went back and looked and yes his penis was like bulging in that video so then I hastily took it down. 

Also, I would happily upload the video/Live Photo but I don’t know how. So technowizards do your thing.",1239
TIFU: I got my boss for Secret Santa.,t2_hljlz,"
He told me (not knowing I was his Secret Santa) that this was his first ever ‘gift exhange’. I felt like I had to make it count. We all had to fill out a paper saying “what color you like”, “what’s your favorite thing”, etc. So I got his paper. He likes a specific candy, a specific beer, and what not. He’s had literally the same mask this whole pandemic. So I wanted to get him a new one! 


In my Etsy order, I got him, my husband, and myself new masks. All are black. My husband has a “large”. My boss and I got the same size “medium”. I have bought the mask that I’m getting for my boss for both my husband and I multiple times. I think this mask is super comfortable, as far as masks go. I decided I wanted a different mask. A cute “feminine” mask that’s different, but from the same company. It’s a lacy black mask. Same shape, same everything. 



The company that made the mask folded the lacy part on the inside. Honestly, with USPS going the way it is, it took longer than expected to get to my house. I even told my boss on the 26th that “I’m his Secret Santa and to not worry because it’ll come in soon”. I didn’t want him to think he was forgotten on his first gift exchange. Anyway, I got him his favorite chocolate and his favorite beer. And his mask. 



Turns out, I gave him my lacy mask. And I guess kudos to him, he wore it for a couple days. He showed it to me (and others) on a video conference. I literally couldn’t see the lace on it so I was like “oh this is great! He likes the gift I got him!”. Well luckily one of the other managers saw the lacy part and told him “you don’t really pull off that look”. He said this I think a couple days before my boss switched back to his old mask. Anyway, he told me today that his mask looks like “underwear” and the other manager was constantly telling him this. 



Needless to say I immediately went home (how on earth could I work the rest of the day knowing my boss thinks I got him a lacy mask?) and got the other mask and swapped it out (I have a winter mask I’ve been wearing, so I haven’t worn the new one yet). He likes the new one! 

TLDR: I got my boss a lacy black mask for Christmas and he wore it because he’s nice and because I got it for him.",618

this happened when i was in elementary and i had the most strict, high tempered teacher ever.



after the morning classes. i go home from school for lunch to prepare for the afternoon classes. then my dad told me that hes going out of town for work so hes gonna drive me to school early.

he drives me to school. then i go to the hallway. then the classroom door. 

the door is closed.

i try to open it.

door didnt open.

another guy from a different section arrives.

he just watches as i try to open the door.

and then. the roar of the most hated teacher inside the room.

we ran. scared as shit.

once the coast is clear.
we came back and went to our own classrooms.

then class starts. she announces that theres people who tried to break in. and she told that one of them had a black jacket (which i wore) and then walked by me and looked at me in the eyes then went to her desk. then started class.

(mission of didnt get caught: success)

and after a few days i was walking around since it was recess and overheard teachers talking/gossiping about the ""attempted break in""

TIFU by creating a yeast bomb,t2_17icdl,"So yesterday I decided to prep the batter for some blinis (basically savoury pancakes). Hadn't made them in years so had to look up the recipe. Its pretty simple. Get some lukewarm milk, add yeast, add flour, let rest in the fridge overnight. So I did.

Happy with the result of mixing it all together, my eyes fell on a liter sized airtight jam jar with one of those hinged lids. poured the batter in, man was it satisfying to se it fit with barely any extra space to spare. I closed the lid tight and put it on the top shelf of the fridge.

Now you see this recipe contains yeast. On top of beeing this ball of active bacteria it has this other nifty feature of making dough expand. It does this by generating gas in it (carbon dioxide I believe). This small feature I forgot about was about to be my downfall.

I had dinner with my gf, and then we went out for a walk. On coming back we planned on some Netflix and chill. As such, about an hour post blini storing, I open the fridge to get the dip.

When adding gas to a sealed container, you get pressure. Clearly at some point while out, that pressure became to much and the lid of my jar was blown of. As such The sight I was greeted to was like a male Narwhale with a fridgefetish had come to visit. Runny goopy batter everywhere. And as we all know shit flows downwards, the batter had first sprayed, then overflowed the top shelf, poured down and overflowed the middle shelf, bottom shelf, and finally into the vegetable drawer, naturally covering everything in the fridge while doing so.

As you might expect, cozy time was delayed by a couple hours of me cleaning the fridge. In the end I was left with around 3 dl of the original 1 liter of batter still in the jar. Thankfully my better half was at least gracefull enough to feel sorry for me.

TL;DR: Put yeast in a pressure vessel. Its no longer a pressure vessel.",19
TIFU by getting my balls twisted,t2_6fj69i8v,"Obligatory this happened last night and reporting from my hospital bed this morning. My girlfriend and I were in a Chipotle parking lot when I see a father in the next car over (parked pretty close) letting me get out of the car first. I tried to hurry up getting out cause it was cold as hell out. Then, I get the feeling that my balls just got squished. Thought no big deal I’ll ride the pain out. One hour later, the pain is still there and I’m about to vomit. Worse pain of my life. As I’m sitting on the toilet letting the boys dangle (even though they were packed up nice and tight and now swollen) I read about testicular torsion on WebMD. Shit, I might lose my ball. Went to urgent care and was told to go to the ER. 2 hours later (and a lost covid test delaying my surgery. Thanks doc) I’m being put under the  knife for the first time. When I come to a wonderful nurse gave me Mardi Gras beads, sparkling apple sauce, and a pair of 2021 glasses. Thank you all nurses doctors and surgeons and staff for putting your life on the line for my balls and everyone else. I just hope my insurance covers party supplies. Happy 2021 y’all. 

Edit: sparkling applesauce is what they give you after they put you on a shit ton of morphine and anesthesia. It looks and taste a lot like sparkling apple juice but when you’re that far gone you mistype and say applesauce.

TIFU by asking a man-child to commit.,t2_8htuhp2n,"I got to know this guy virtually a couple of years ago because of college projects and we got talking casually. We soon formed a pact where we wouldn't try getting to know each other's circle, and that whatever we discussed would be contained just between the both of us. 
This progressed really well and soon we were spilling out our secrets and stupidity. We met up in real and started dating. He asked me to be his girlfriend and I wasn't ready to commit at that point.

There was this brief break and soon enough, I just couldn't stop thinking about him. So I went back and asked him if we could atleast go back to being friends. Eventually, I gathered enough courage and asked him if he wanted to be in a relationship with me, the answers weren't exactly straight, but didn't give away that he wasn't interested. 

We lived considerably far away and meeting him was tough during the pandemic, not that he made an effort to meet. There were brief breaks in the interaction, I however thought that we finally had reached a point where it would be right to ask him to get serious considering the interest he projected. The conversation spiralled into a one sided blame game where he let me down saying I was the one who didn't seem serious. This escalated into something ugly and now we don't speak anymore.

I fucked up by asking too soon. 

TL;DR I asked a guy to stop beating around the bush and get serious about the relationship we were in. The conversation got ugly and it didn't end well.",13
TIFU by taking a morning walk and looking stupid,t2_5x9zloyl,"Okay so my husband is out of town right now and it’s just me at home. My sleep schedule is kind of a mess when he’s gone and so I couldn’t even fall asleep until about midnight last night. I woke up just after 3am after having a nightmare and I couldn’t fall back asleep after that. 

Well I decided to take a shower and relax for a bit but I have really been wanting to work out since I haven’t been to the gym for months now (cause of our good friend rona...). So I decided to go for a nice walk down to the grocery store and back which is about a two mile walk, perfect for sleepy me! I live right outside of a Capital city and that typically means there’s a lot of fun characters looming around at night and it’s best to be safe when it’s dark outside. I dressed in baggy sweats and a loose hoodie which I had the hood pulled up and scrunched on so that nobody could tell I am a young easily beaten and robbed scrawny gal. If it were during the day I wouldn’t have gone through the effort but it was almost 6am and still completely dark outside and I was very comfy like that. 

So I get walking and it was a great brisk morning!! I was totally vibing to my music and just having a wonderful time waking up. Well when I get towards the store I came across the first person I had seen. He was just some average guy and I didn’t think much of it. As I got closer I pulled up my mask from my chin to over my nose and mouth just to be considerate and safe. Well it was chilly outside and the mask made my glasses fog up so much that I couldn’t see anything. 

Next thing I know I run smack dab right into one of those cord things connected to a power pole. I half way spun around and almost fell down and it nearly knocked off my glasses. I made a very loud “ACKKK” sound and stammered off to the side of the sidewalk to collect myself and let the guy pass. When I took my glasses off and got the fog off and looked back up I noticed that he has passed 5 LANES TO THE OTHER SIDE JUST TO AVOID ME. Note that we were very close to a stop light so he could have crossed earlier but only did so after seeing my debacle. He just saw this random dark figure run right into a pole and yell and he was like “nope” and dipped. I was SO embarrassed I wanted to yell after him and say i’m not on drugs i’m fine but omg I died a little inside after that. I know it’s not the biggest FU but man was I embarrassed lol. Other then that it was a wonderful walk and I am probably going to make it a recurring thing!! 

TL;DR: I went on a morning walk dressed like a creeper and ran right into a pole and freaked out a guy probably making him think I was super drugged up or something",21
TIFU by washing my sheets.,t2_58kwr,"So this happened yesterday. My sheets had gotten stained from a popsicle incident, so I decided to throw them in the wash. I went ahead and took off my mattress cover as well because it had been a while since that had been washed as well. After throwing them in I noticed some very some shiny threads on my black shirt, which I didn't think much about until later. after getting my sheets and mattress cover out of the dryer I went ahead and put them on the bed and proceeded to lay down. Shortly after that I begin to start feeling an itch, followed by another itch, followed by several dozen more. After some investigating and guesswork I realized that someone had the ingenious idea to put a thin cover over the foam mattress that seems to have been made of/ contained fiberglass. This cover was hidden under the factory mattress cover, and as I took off the mattress cover a lot of fiberglass went with that and spread through all of my sheets. today I am at work with probably hundreds of little fiberglass needles all over me because I can still feel them. I don't know how to fix this issue, and there is a chance I am out a set of sheets and a mattress cover.

TIFU by squirting 90% isopropyl alcohol directly into my eye,t2_1743zu,"Obligatory disclaimer: this happened like 5-6 years ago or something. 

Back story: I was working in the ER at the time, and had several syringes of sterile normal saline at home, which I brought from work. I mostly used these to clean the scratches I would acquire from indoor/outdoor cats (originally feral then domesticated), and I would fill some of them up with isopropyl alcohol after using up the normal saline, as a way to conveniently clean wounds with alcohol (as I learned shortly after, it's not necessary at all to clean wounds with alcohol). I'm mildly allergic to cats as well but they're so goddamn cute and I can't help but love them, so figured I could just deal with cleaning the minor scratches.

  
I come home one morning after working a night shift. One of the cats had diarrhea'd on the carpet, so I brought out the stain removal cleaning solution. It was jammed, and upon trying to fix the cap, I accidentally sprayed it up into the air. I thought I got some in my eye, so I removed my contact immediately and grabbed a normal saline syringe to irrigate my eyeball. I put the syringe up to my eye and felt a tingle, so I thought, ""ah, definitely got some of that stain removal in my eye, better clean it out with some saline.""

It just happened to be the ONE syringe that I put alcohol in. 

My eyeball immediately began to burn intensely and I proceeded to rinse my eye out with regular tap water out of panic. It felt like I was doing it for 5 minutes but probably not. I walked over to my roommate, who was sleeping, and asked her to drive me back up to the ER where I worked. 

I was treated with antibiotic eye ointment, as well as some tetracaine for the pain. Sent home, and for days I was in excruciating pain and fear, unable to sleep. I went to the eye specialist in the next couple of days (this happened on a Friday night so the specialist was not open over the weekend) who informed me that I burned off about 3/5 of my cornea. He had to physically shave off the remaining lips of the cornea so he could smoothly apply a bandage contact which I would keep on for 4-5 days. 

Somehow, I never suffered any permanent damage except for a bit of emotional trauma. I thought I was going to be blind in my right eye. I'm fine now though. And I have since learned not to replace NS with alcohol, and not to clean my wounds with alcohol.   


TL;DR - thought I was irrigating my eye with normal saline but it turned out to be isopropyl alcohol, burned off 3/5 of my cornea, had days of non-stop pain and no sleep, but I'm all G now.",41
TIFU by eating mini muffins that expired 5 months ago,t2_49fauq3k,"A break from the obligatory didn't happen today. Happened 5 minutes ago and I'm debating whether I should write my will...

Basically I was hungry and my parents would probably get mad if I was in the kitchen at 12 AM so I went downstairs into an old purse we had and got out some tasty cake Mini Muffins. It's pretty cold down there and they weren't moldy at all, so I failed to notice that they expired in September.

Long story short I ate them. I'm literally terrified and having a panic attack... am I going to die? Should I sleep tonight? How bad will it be? Someone help me please... 

TL;DR: I ate mini muffins that expired in September and Google is no help. Will I die? They weren't moldy and they were in a cold place and in a sealed container.

Edit: I'm fine now, I was having a panic attack yesterday over something else and just kind of freaked out about this too. Thanks for the advice :)",4
TIFU by scaring the shit out of myself and burning my pp and hitting my head,t2_228podwb,"This actually happend like an hour ago. English is my first language however I am an idiot (as I will now prove)

It was about 0530 am and I haven't slept in about 24 hours now due to the whole ""one more episode before bed"" fiasco. I haven't eaten for about 9 hours so I decide to go downstairs and have some canned macaroni cheese before my stomach wakes the whole house up. 

For some much needed context I park my motorbike outside my front door even though it has been stolen twice from that very spot. I am also only wearing boxers and socks.

Once the bowls in the microwave I start cleaning the can out and hear some noises outside but chalk it up to a mixture of me being tired and the JD I had 4 hours ago to help me sleep quicker. 

I get my bowl of piping hot macaroni and carefully carry it towards my room but as I'm passing the front door I hear some more noises. So I creep up to the door to look through the window and dont see anything. In my infinite wisdom I decided to turn the light on behind me then have another quick check out of the window at my pride and joy. 

I look back at the window and about 6 inches away from the glass is a shirtless, homeless looking guys tearing into my very soul. Naturally I shit myself and slip backwards on the smooth floor, hit my head on the floor and manage to spill my macaroni cheese on my crotch which went straight though my boxers and really fucking hurts.

I rush to the shower after ripping my boxers off to try to cool my junk down and it is then that I realise that I got so scared of my own reflection that I managed to hit my head on the floor, burn my manhood and loose any pride I once had.  TIL: I need a fucking shave

TL;DR made macaroni cheese, went to investigate noise with macaroni cheese, saw my reflection and shit myself then subsequently mutilated my manhood and wasted some good food",245
TIFU by cranking the wrong joke on a discord server,t2_6a079ena,"So it was a normal weekday, I was chatting in one of the servers I had recently joined (note that the server was French, I'm not French neither do I know the language) so I was chatting away, it was a method to kill time. Anyway time went on and I got to a point when I had to go do some irl stuff. So I said goodbye and got ready to leave, then I remembered that I had to crank a joke before I left (note again: I had the pfp and name of an anime character at that time it was Gray Fullbuster from fairy tail, for any who have not seen the show he has a habit of stripping at random times which is of course used for comedic purposes, also my profile pic showed him without pants, btw he wore underwear) so I gathered my options and thought that the best one to tell would be: ""let me put on my pants before I leave"" which was really stupid on me cause they ended up thinking i was some kind of sick pedo and i ended up with a wounded pride and a ban.  

TL;DR cracked a fairy tail joke in a discord server, got insta banned and now all of that server probably thinks I'm some kind of pedo.",13
TIFU by telling my MIL she’s the reason her son has crippling depression.,t2_72tjubxx,"
When I met my husband in our early 20’s he was the love of my life. We quickly eloped and started our life together. He changed a year later right after we got a computer. His self care became infrequent and he became depressed. He’d game up to 21 hours a day and stopped working. We went to counseling and he admitted that he’d always neglected his self care growing up, tried to get out of going to school and doing any kind of work. He said when he wanted to date he changed to be outgoing and it worked. 
The root of his problems were from being raised by a hoarder, just like the ones on TV, plus too many animals.
He has a younger brother who came out of the situation seemingly unharmed. Of anyone I’ve ever known, him and his wife have the ideal life. He can afford for her to stay home and they raised their 3 boys into great young men who are now in college. They live in a stunning spotless home and are the center of hundreds of people’s social circle. Completely involved parents, coaching, team mom, PTA, musicians, travel. Just the best people. 
My husband hasn’t much improved in the last 20 years. He receives treatment but the only situation it alleviates is his anxiety, it doesn’t make him any more productive. 
His mother is up in age and needing help with shopping, appointments and lifting. Because we live closest, that’s been our responsibility for several months.
While driving her yesterday, she was venting about how my husband isn’t as helpful as she wants him to be. She wants to go out shopping several times a week and he’s only helpful with the necessities. Then she made a comment that she thinks one of my nephews is going to turn out just like him because he’s been too busy to take her shopping to (a 4 hour round trip) Without thinking, I responded “That’s ridiculous because he was raised way better” She got wide eyed and defended herself saying that my husband was helpful before he met me, but I know that’s a lie. I saw what she raised him in when we met, and no one was doing anything in that house. I tried to backpedal and say I meant my nephew was raised by 2 parents. She then asked me if I had a problem with single mothers? We were silent the rest of the ride. 
Still waiting for the family drama but maybe she will self reflect and not tell anyone. 
TLDR My husband has severe mental illness from being raised by a hoarder. When my MIL mentioned she believes my nephew was going to be just like him, I told her it’s not possible because he has good parents.",92
TIFU by starving myself for months,t2_29v4ylq9,"For the past couple months, I've (21F) been using Weight Watchers to lose some weight and eat healthier. For those of you who don't know, weight watchers uses a points system instead of counting calories. I get 30 points a day to spend on food, and 30 weekly ""extra"" points if I want to eat more than the allotted 30 points in a day. The points are very abstract and take into account calories, carbs, fats, protein and probably more. Things like fruits and veggies are no points (except avocados) and high carb, low protein foods, like bread, are tons of points. In order to shame you for using too many extra points weight watchers color codes your days: blue days are days you stayed within 5 points of your goal, white days are days you went too many over.

My boyfriend has always been skeptical of weight watchers. He doesn't like how abstract the points are and the lack of transparency about what a point actually means, or how it doesn't tell you how fast you're losing weight or what it's goal weight for you is. Today he decided to look back though and calculate how many calories are in the average point, just out of curiosity (this is a man who makes spreadsheets for fun). Turns out weight watchers has been making me eat under 1000 calories a day, with the majority of my days being around 700 to stay in the healthy blue day range.

Weight Watchers has literally been starving me! I'm 5'4 151 pounds, according to calorie calculators I should be eating 1300 a day to lose a pound a week, not averaging 700! My boyfriend has been getting exasperated with me for always talking about being so hungry, and it turns out thats because I've been eating just over half as much food as I thought I was and should be! He now understands my plight. I've switched over to a calorie counting app, leaving weight watchers behind.

TL;DR: Weight Watchers has been shaming me every day I eat more than 700 calories for the past several months, so I've been starving myself for its approval, not knowing how little it was making me eat.",1555
TIFU by thinking my WiFi was messed up.,t2_3kdfgsmh,"This just happened 30 minutes ago. I was on the internet as per usual on my laptop and my daughter on her phone. All of the sudden, the Wifi stopped working. I did as much trouble shooting on my end as I could (or so I thought) and after that, I decided to call my service provider. I get him on the line and tell him my WiFi is down and he tells me that everything is in order. We go back and forth for like 10 minutes until my daughter went to the router and noticed the lights were off and told me as much (I feel so dumb and didn't even think to check that) and it turns out that my breaker had flipped off for that outlet bc I plugged up an extra space heater in my bathroom that has the same connection as my router. I felt like an ass that I argued with a poor guy for 10 minutes, insisting it was my Wifi connection. I wish I could apologize to him for wasting his time but as we all know, It's almost impossible to get connected with the same person at a call center.

Tl:Dr I thought my wifi was out but it was my breaker box that flipped off due to too much electricity being used in 2 outlets 🤦‍♀️",6
TIFU By making my Venmo name @SenatorMitchMcConnell and simply destroying my main email's inbox,t2_sem0z,"Well. We all saw the Reddit thread about how people were requesting money from Mitch McConnell on Venmo and Paypal. I wanted to do it too because why not.

But when I looked up Mitch McConnell, nothing came up except a random guy, and I noticed that the tag SenatorMitchMcConnell was open. And me, in a very tired and somewhat joking type of mood at 3 AM on New Years decided it would be a good idea to set that to my tag, change my profile pic to Ol' Mitch, and go to sleep.

Well, I just woke up and my inbox is just fucking destroyed. Like seriously. 5 requests a minute. Thank god it was only for like 6 hours since I woke up early today but I'm going to be deleting for a long time.

Time to get to it.

My girlfriend woke up to hundreds of notifications because a while ago she sent me $0.50 with the message ""Fuck you"" and I guess people thought she was sticking it to Mitch bc it got liked a ton of times... lesson learned to not pose as one of the most disliked men in America

EDIT Part 2: After inspection, it seems like the rate was about 10 requests a minute

TIFU by purchasing Persona Endless Night Collection,t2_11hdxgg,"(Apologies for bad mobile formatting.)
*Also, obligatory “this was not today.”*
Soooo, allow me to give a bit of context. 
Persona Dancing: Endless Night Collection is a bundle of three Persona Dancing games: 3, 4, and 5. 4 being the most interesting, with a story mode and best OST in my opinion, while the other two being basic rehashes of this game with different OSTs, dances and models without any real story mode. 
As part of the bundle, Persona 4 Dancing is a digital download as opposed to the other two being physical discs. 
Cut to receiving this bundle on Christmas, and to my surprise; *The digital download code had expired 20 days earlier.* It was never specified before purchasing that this was an issue, and nothing much has come out of customer service. 
All I could find was other people with the same issue warning people *not* to buy the bundle. P3D and P5D are... mediocre, but it’s also bad on my part for not looking into things before walking into disappointment.
EDIT: gramatical errors 
TL;DR: Bought Persona Dancing collection, ended up without the best game in the collection.",0
TIFU by sending a picture of my pants around my ankles to a would-be date,t2_8do58mob,"Yeah, this just happened. Feeling a little silly, but in context I'm still a bit bewildered.

So yesterday me (24M) and this guy (28M) get talking on Grindr, and we hit it off so we take the convo to Instagram. We're generally both good at talking banter and taking the piss out of ourselves/each other.

Fast forward to today, and I'm working during the day but have arranged to meet this guy for a drinks or whatever later. So throughout the day we jokingly ""cancel"" on each other - he cancelled on me for preferring tonic rather than soda with my gin, I cancel for some other minor reason. But it's all sarcastic and good fun.

Then, at one particular point (I've been messaging for hours at my desk since it's a quiet day), I get up and go to the bathroom. At the same time, he tells me jokingly to ""get back to work."" Me, sitting on the toilet, naturally want to send something funny back. So I send an expiring snap of my pants around my ankles - no genitals or anything. And then say ""I'm taking a break.""

(For context, a couple of my friends and I have a running joke of taking a pic of pants around our ankles at various random times... I know I know.)

At first, I think his reaction of disgust is sarcastic, like the earlier times we've ""cancelled."" 

And then I realise he's actually being serious. He says he ""couldn't be more turned off"" and asks me to stop messaging him. I say goodbye and unfollow on Insta, and I check later and he's done the same.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you fuck up a date before you've even met the guy.

TL;DR sent a picture of pants around my ankles to a guy I'd be seeing later tonight, which goes down... not great and he cancels.",2
TIFU by getting creampied,t2_79nth0kl,"Tifu So to set the scene, my s/o and I are having a lazy day after the new years festivities. We've been laying in bed all day fried, and she suddenly decides she wants a chocolate creampie. So naturally the puns were flowing all the way to the store and back. We ate like half the pie and the jokes started to lead into intimacy. Cut to I'm butt ass naked and she gives me a playful push onto the bed, and my ass landed right in the creampie. I never took it off my bed. So now I'm just laying on my belly, frantically trying to clean pie creme out of my ass crack. after all afternoon of making creampie jokes, I didn't know that i would be the one to get creamed lol. It was hilarious, but that out an end to that for the evening. I gotta post it on here because it's a little TMI to share with my friends or roommates. The new year is really bringing something new.

Tldr: while making sexy time and joking about creampies, while eating a creampie, I accidentally sat on it and creampied my bare ass

"TIFU by getting drunk, getting into a political argument and storming out.",t2_80jvqb52,"I know I'm in the wrong , I guess writing it out on text is kind of therapeutic. So I , against my better judgement got into a political debate. I've majored in philosophy and politics. I've always had an interest in the subject. I've always prided myself in being level headed , giving others respect and listening to them. So I'm very disappointed in myself.

I was at a party the alcohol was flowing and we some how got into a conversation about poverty and choices. I was explaining from my point of view that people in poverty don't have many choices. He disagreed and that's fine. The conversation started to feel personal. I should had excited but I didn't. My friend brought up the company I worked for. The guy I was chatting to laughed at me. I tried to defend my position and explain why I've made some of the life style choices I've made. I don't know why but something just flipped inside of me I walked out and slammed the door. My friend was not best pleased and said if I did not calm down I'd have to leave. I later apologised but I feel like I've messed up big time. I feel like I should had excited the conversation earlier I should had been more aware of myself....Whelp guess I will have to live with this embarrassment.

TL;DR I got drunk at a party and got overly involved in a political conversation. Ended up slamming a door and almost being asked to leave.",1
TIFU by Trusting Macrame,t2_6c1h8oov,"In the great tradition of this sub, this happened today, if by ""today"" we mean back in the 80's....

It is a warm summer day.  My brother and a couple friends, ages 12-15, are bored AF.  We think maybe climbing trees could be good, a common pastime as we are half-monkey and our neighborhood has plenty of climbable trees, but we'd climbed each a hundred times.  We are looking for something new.

*We yearn for adventure.*

And there it is, right across the street--a great, majestic oak, growing right next to the road in an undeveloped lot full of trees, bushes and myrtle.  You can see exactly how to climb this glorious monster--go from that lowest branch to that branch to that branch....  Problem is, that lowest branch sits 15' off the ground.  Now there is another tree kind of next to the oak, a tree with a relatively thin trunk and no branches until way up, perfect for shimmying up like a pole.  But, perhaps intimidated by the majesty of the great oak, it kind of leans away from the monster we want to climb, and by the time you get high enough to be on level with the great oak's branches, the pole tree leans too far away for the oak to be reached.  We'd tried.

But none of that matters today!  For today is the day **that oak shall be conquered!!**

What we need is rope to get to that first branch, so we dive into my friends' garage.  Now, this two-car garage hasn't housed a car in years, it's so full of junk.  We are looking for rope but will settle for something rope-like, maybe one of those 100' long orange extension cords or something.  Finally, my buddy calls out, ""I've got it!"".

I turn to look.

He isn't holding a rope, or an extension cord, or clothes line.  He is holding a [macrame plant holder](https://www.wescover.com/p/macrame-wall-hanging-by-stephanie-echeveste-at-private-residence--PHJnuQBcAU).

Now, if you don't know, macrame is basically knotted yarn.  And if you don't know, the 70's were a crazy, confusing time.  Along with disco, drugs, bell-bottoms and porn 'staches, one of the archetypal artefacts of the 70's were these macrame plant holders--you'd have a long trail of macrame ending with a big tassel hanging from a hook in your ceiling.  But it didn't end at the hook--it would gracefully make its way to another hook.  And if it was special, it'd proceed from there to yet another hook.  If it was extra-special, it might then proceed to yet another hook in the ceiling.  From there it would descend into a knitted basket in which you put your plant.  That is what passed for home decor in the 70's--a giant yarn rope hanging from multiple hooks to hold up a plant.  Don't do drugs, kids.

Anyway, my buddy had found an extra-special, yellow-green macrame refugee from the 70's that was at least 50' long if it was a foot.

""Dude, that's not rope,"" I reply.  ""That's friggin' yarn.  There's no way macrame is going to hold our body weight.""

""Yes it will!  It's strong!  See?"" he says, pulling on it.

We argue a bit before I tell him fine, I'll show him it won't work.  We toss the plant end over the majestic oak's lowest branch, the others brace themselves holding onto the other end, and I put my foot in the plant holder loops.  Amazingly, it supports my weight.  Not wanting to get halfway up and it breaking, I jump up and down several times, trying to snap it.  It holds!

**We are going to conquer that oak!!1!**

Excited to be the first one up the tree, I put my ass in the sling and the others heave me up.  There I am, 15' up, my chest against the lowest branch, and... I can't figure out how to get my ass out of the sling and onto the branch.  I decide that we need to redo this with me standing in the loop rather than sitting so I can step out of it, so I turn my head to the other three to tell them this.  But at that moment, a funny thing happens.  All three fall backwards onto their asses, as though they'd been pulling hard on something that had just snapped.  How strange....

Next thing I know, gravity happens.  You see, oak has very rough bark.  And while the yarn had (surprisingly enough) had enough strength to hold my weight, as my friends had hauled me up, that yarn had been dragged across the oak's bark, shredding it....

Having been in a relaxed sitting position, when I start plummeting earthwards, my knees come up to my chest, and I find myself plummeting towards the ground basically ass-first.

""Man, this is going to hurt when I land,"" I think to myself.

I am wrong.  Agonizing pain sets in while I am still falling.

Remember that pole-like tree that leans slightly away from the oak?  My back starts sliding down it, its bark lifts my shirt up to my neck and the bark starts tearing off the skin on my back like a cheese-grater with serious anger issues.

""Aaaah!"" I say.

But then another, horrifying thought occurs to my pain-addled brain:  that oak is right next to the road--am I going to land on earth or cement??  I look down, see that the road is a couple feet over from me, so at least I'm not going to land on cement....

Turns out, I am wrong about that too.

You know those cement cinder blocks used in construction, like two squares of cement pushed together?  And you know how it's practically a law of physics that the broken end of one of those things will randomly show up wherever nature and man are in close proximity?  Well, the tree that is tearing up my back changes the trajectory of my fall just enough so that my tailbone comes crashing down onto one of those square cinder block ends which had been stealthily lying in wait under the myrtle at the base of the tree.  Hitting that unyielding cement, the vertebrae in my back all violently slam together at once, agony blossoms across my back with such intensity it completely eclipses my shredded skin, and I fall over to my side and then onto my back with the wind knocked out of me more severely than I'd known possible.

There I am, lying on my back staring at the sky, completely deprived of breath, and it's not going away--my lungs are so seized up, time is passing and *it's not starting to fade away.*  I start panicking, fearing that maybe I will suffocate and die before I regain my ability to breathe. I see my friends circle around me.  ""Dave, are you alright?  Dave, say something, are you okay?""

I desperately want to tell them no I'm not okay, call 911, but I'm so wracked with pain I can't move and I still can't make a sound.

One of my friends grows irate with me.  ""Dave, we can see your eyes moving.  We know you aren't dead.  Quit playing dead and say something!""

How can I get him to realize that I'm not saying anything because I can't breathe?  The edges of my vision are starting to get dark, and I'm really panicking.  I focus every ounce of will I can muster, focus it on my breathing, and with the mightiest effort of my life, I desperately try to draw in *some* amount of air into my lungs.

There is the slightest movement, a tiny puff of fresh air enters my lungs, and my throat makes a high-pitched squeaking sound as that tiny puff of air enters my lungs.

Those assholes start laughing at me!  I'm dying and they're laughing!  I'm so mad I try to draw in another breath so I can yell at them, my throat makes another squeaky ""eeep"" sound and they literally fall to the ground laughing their asses off.

Slowly, torturously slowly, my ability to draw breath returns.  My back is in so much agony I wonder if I will ever be pain free again, and I limp home and crawl into bed.

Fortunately, a couple days later and I am fully recovered.

TL;DR: I entrusted my body weight to a macrame plant holder designed to hold like 20 lbs and it went even more catastrophically wrong than you would have imagined.

Epilogue:  Believe it or not, I have 100% successfully managed to avoid entrusting my health and well-being to macrame ever since, and I heartily encourage you, dear reader, to do likewise!

Macrame is the devil's handicraft!!",19
TIFU by going to work,t2_6ktyjqwm,"So I(f17) am in and out of sleep every night, no idea why. I do take melatonin gummies, have been for a couple weeks. I can sleep for 4 hours, sometimes, and the rest of the night I wake up all the time and cant sleep. That's the first problem.

Then I get up out of bed for work at 5:50, really been up since 4ish starting at the ceiling. 

Roads in town are slick as hell an I live in the country so dirt roads suck even more.

So I head to work and I get there at 6:23, usual time I get there. I realize I dont have my key card to clock in. 

Around 7:30ish i think, I am cutting up meat for the kielbasa for lunch. I split my left ring finger open through my glove and I was bleeding, I saved the meat from the blood. I called my coworker over because I needed a bandaid. 

I'm wierd here. I am a hunter. I can do blood, guts, bones, you name it, from animals and humans. I cannot do my own blood, I knew that already. There wasnt a whole lot of blood coming from my finger, but enough to be gushing out. 

So I am doubled over the trashcan next to the sink in the kitchen, I am the cook in an assisted living, while my coworker wraps my finger up. I'm dizzy as f*ck and trying to not pass out or throw up. I couldnt hear shit, everything was so monotoned and low sounding, I could hear clearly, but it was super low if that makes any sense. 

After 10 minutes of that and me finally getting water down, I'm able to stand up straight. Awesome. I still had to serve breakfast to everyone lol. 

Later, I'm about half way done making lunch when we run out of our clear gloves. All we have left are latex gloves. A couple weeks ago, I figured out I'm allergic to latex when i have hives breaking out so bad i cant move my fingers. Awesome. I'm also sweating enough that the bandaid wants to slide of my finger. 

So i get home around 2:15 and i look for my card. Cant find it anywhere. Not inbetween the seats, under them, in my glovebox, nothing. I'm looking for a solid 15 minutes before I fin that my card is stuck between the back and bottom part of the seat. 

When I found my card, my pants ripped at the thigh. Awesome that is the second pair of work pants to do that to me this week. It's a good thing I just bought 2 new pairs for work. I guess my pants cant take my thick? thighs.

I also purposely ditched my car on my way to work three days ago so I would avoid hitting the car in front of me. 

I am at home currently eating a bag of popcorn listen to hair bands from the 80's at 3pm. Greatest music ever. 

I'm now tired and want to sleep. 

How have yalls been?

TL;Dr: couldnt find my keycard for work, cut my finger open, all around *awesome* day",7
TIFU by accidentally mocking my new close friend's dead dad.,t2_2jaoz5ec,"Over quarantine, I've been getting closer to this girl I met through school last year. She's really cool; funny, kind, really pretty (modeling-type pretty), talented, smart, actually has her shit together. I have no idea why she hangs out with me, but... she does.

A few days ago we were hanging out at the mall (masks on, don't worry) and talking about a playlist I made her of songs that reminded me of her. I asked her what songs reminded her of me and she gave me a few. Then I was like, ""Daddy Issues by the Neighborhood"" and laughed, and then said ""that applies to both of us"". And she laughed too, kind of uncomfortably, and then I realized that it was the *anniversary of her father passing away* a few weeks ago. I profusely apologized, but I think that really might have hurt her.

TL;DR: After talking about music, I told my new close friend that she has daddy issues, weeks after she told me her Dad passed away.

TIFU by eating a jar of pickled chilli peppers,t2_8321zr0o,"TIFU by eating a jar of pickled chilli peppers

-

I'm South Asian and our pickles are more than veggies in a pickling liquid. There's a ton of spices and oil and other things that make up a paste, then you add your veggies to it. They make a really good accompaniment to a lot of things.

Today I tried the western style of pickling on some chilli peppers that aren't very hot/spicy (by our standards) and they turned out delicious. I loved it so much that I ended up eating the whole batch (about 15 whole chillies in total) in a span of 30 minutes. I love spicy food and since this was not spicy at all, I was unaffected.

Or so I thought.

An hour later I rush to the toilet to take a dump and felt as if I was literally shitting out lava. My butthole burned more intensely than a thousand suns and every bit of poop that came out was painful as all hell. Towards the end the poop didn't even feel normal. Once I thought I was done, I stood up and turned to examine my handywork in the pot.

I had shat out whole chillies.

Thank the lord for hand held bidets (also called bum guns). I unleashed a jet of cold water in and around my butthole to calm it down to a level that no longer felt like I was using a piece of hot coal as a buttplug.

As I type this, I lie in bed, whimpering, hoping that this will go away soon.

TIFU by accidentally creating a false bomb threat causing the entire school to go on lockdown,t2_8sts8g6x,"As is tradition, this happened about thirteen years ago and I am on mobile.

I attended an exceedingly poorly run middle school where the administration decided the best response to kids fighting/throwing food in the cafeteria was to make everyone wait outside for the first lunch shift to clear out the cafeteria before the next lunch shift could enter. Anyone who has worked with middle schoolers knows corralling them is like herding cats and the lunch shifts were severely understaffed. So kids would lolly-gag in the cafeteria to avoid going to class and hold up the lunch shifts. This meant that by the last lunch shift, we spent 1/3-1/2 of our half hour lunch waiting outside in the Texas heat.

My best friend, “Jasper,” and I got bored waiting for lunch and, being the massive geeks that we are, decided to re-enact Potter Puppet Pals, specifically “The Mysterious Ticking Noise.” (I now despise JK Rowling’s TERF stances, anti-semitism and cultural appropriation and the irony of two closeted trans kids being her biggest fans at the time is not lost on me). As many of you probably know, this episode involves very obnoxious puppets singing about Snape only to be interrupted by a mysterious ticking which turns out to be a pipe bomb. Now, Potter Puppet Pals wasn’t exactly standard fare in our part of Texas and most of our peers were quiet bewildered by the two oddly dressed kids putting on very poor British accents and jumping around, but they were used to our strange antics at this point and payed us no mind. By the end of the third rendition of this annoying parody ear worm, we were allowed to enter the cafeteria.

About five minutes into the next period, the principal came on the aging PA system to tell us the entire school was on lockdown and teachers were to search every student’s bag. I think they might have brought in  search dogs as well but I could’ve been combining this with another incident. I wasn’t too concerned as kids had brought in drugs before and was happy to bury my nose in my fantasy novel. At the end of the day, the school passed out letters for our parents explaining a student overheard two other students talking about a bomb and the school was placed on lockdown.

I quickly put two and two together, realizing someone overheard our little rendition of “The Mysterious Ticking Noise” and reported it to a teacher. Apparently they either felt the need to finish their meager school lunch first or the lunch monitor couldn’t be bothered with it until the next period. I panicked, as I was generally an anxious kid and we were in the height of the late 2000s Zero Tolerance movement, thinking I would be expelled if anyone realized Jasper and I were the cause of the bomb threat. Jasper, being quite used to my angst, agreed to be sworn to silence until we graduated middle school, at which point he promptly told all the kids at writing camp much to their amusement.

TL;DR: My best friend “Jasper,” and I got bored and re-enacted “The Mysterious Ticking Noise” outside our middle school cafeteria, only for another kid to overhear and report us for bringing a pipe bomb to school. The entire school got shut down for a bomb threat and I spent the better part of a year worrying I’d be expelled",2
TIFU by spitting mucus directly in someone's face,t2_2uphvx91,"This happened multiple years ago. When I was younger, my school took the entire class on a week-long trip to an island via ferry. A couple things to make the story make more sense: 

a. This trip was the literal highlight of the school experience. Everyone in the lower grades looked forward to it, this wasn't something you wanted to miss

b. Even though this was pre-covid, they were very strict about making sure that no one going was sick. They had everyone do temperature checks before even getting on the boat, and did not at all hesitate to send people home early 

c. I was sick :D

Okay, so on to the fuck up! I showed up to the boat even though I had a pretty bad cold at the time. By that I mean coughing, hacking, and constant spitting up of wads of mucus. I passed the temperature check by the skin of my teeth (I was actually a bit too warm, but since it wasn't by much they let it slide). Once the boat actually starts moving, it becomes clear that this was a shit idea because it turns out that *being on the freezing cold deck of a ferry in early March while sick* is a horrible fucking idea. 

So I'm on the open deck, freezing my ass off, and my nose starts getting really stuffy and stopped up. I do that thing where you kinda suck all the mucus into your mouth, and I'm sitting there with my cheeks full of phlegm while I try to figure out what to do with it. 

And then in all my glorious stupidity, I decide that the best to get rid of all the slime would be to spit it over the side of the boat while it's in motion. The wind then picks up the huge ass wad of phlegm, carries it a couple of feet down the side of the boat, and proceeds to deposit it directly in someone's face. 

There's an immediate shriek and people start freaking out. A bunch of people start surrounding the unfortunate soul, asking her if she's okay while she's trying to wipe the mucus off her face with her sleeves. Once the girl's calmed down, everyone involved is trying to figure out where the humongous loogie came from. Meanwhile, I'm silently panicking because you can *tell* from the color of phlegm if someone is sick, and I'm just waiting for some teacher to drag me below deck to call my parents and send me home. 

No one found me :) And that poor girl has yet to know that I'm the one who spat in her face that one time. 

tl;dr: I went on a school trip I technically wasn't supposed to be on, then proceeded to put my presence there in danger by spitting in someone's face",12
TIFU by trying to donate blood and accidentally entering a military zone,t2_go03k,"Ok, as most, this wasn’t today, but was around 2015 Thanksgiving.   I have always made a calendar reminder to donate blood, and when my reminder came up I scheduled via the Red Cross app at the closest place that was available.  

I didn’t really think much of it and just went to the place.  It turned up to be a local military base.  I mean, I was allowed to enroll for donation, so again didn’t think much of it after the restricted entry sign and continued on.   After parking in the lot, didn’t see any obvious signs or the Red Cross truck, pedestrian gate was open, so I wandered around a bit until I stumbled upon a holiday party and asked someone where the donation area was.   They directed me to a garage area in the back.  

Once I got there to the place to give donation, I got the third degree on how I got there and my credentials.   What’s your vehicle, how did you get in here??!

Needless to say, I excused myself and left.  

Tl, dr:  tried to donate blood, and accidentally entered a no-entry zone.",103
TIFU by feeding my dog chili cheese fries,t2_9epi2kbp,"So, I love my dog. He is a black, 120 lb English blockhead lab. Like pretty much all labs he is very food driven. He has those big, brown, begging lab eyes that make you say, “Okay, Teddy, I don’t want my dinner. You can have it.” So he gets a lot of table food. He has discovered my kids and nephew are very easy marks and gets at least 50% of what they are eating. Now, on to the fuck up. I am sick. I do not know if its COVID yet. I ordered some food from Uber eats because I can’t even stand up long enough to prepare food for my kids. The spot I ordered from had a buy one get one special going. Got the chili cheese fries for my mom, who was helping out with the boys. Kids had chicken and waffles. Teddy had some chicken and waffles too. Now there is this whole extra order of chili cheese fries sitting on the table. Teddy starts begging. Apparently, when sick, I’m an easy mark too. I let the Teddy have them. Jesus H Christ the farts being directed at me right now. They smell like sauerkraut. Old sauerkraut. The kind that sat in the pot for a few days because rather than dumping it in the garbage your spouse just put a lid on the pot and left it on the stove for you to discover at a later date. My whole house smells like ass sauerkraut. How is that even possible? I do not understand the magic of lab asses that make chili cheese fries turn into eau de sauerkraut.
TL;DR If you’re the type of weirdo who wants their house to smell like some kind of yankee candle from hell give your dog chili cheese fries.",5
TIFU by drunkenly getting lost in a new country with only a backpack full of stolen broken glass.,t2_11z2kq,"Much like many stories here, this didn't happen today, but about 6 years ago.

In college when I studied abroad, after the second day of exploring our new neighborhood, my classmates and I decided to stop by a pub to well, get sloshed. There were probably a couple dozen of us together that filtered in and out of the pub, and since it was already a popular place, it was hard for us to pack in at once but we finally made it. It was a really cool Irish pub (not in Ireland) with normal high tops, booths, a bar, and an upper deck area that looked down onto the main seating area.

A few of us claimed a high table before downing several rounds of Irish Car Bombs (sorry) along with shots and of course a few pints. After we were all a bit tipsy, my klepto friends and I in all our glorious drunkenness, apparently decided that the Guinness glasses they used were really, really cool, and it would be a good idea to take some for souvenirs. They had to be ours. We were nervous about getting caught by the staff nearby, so we had to come up with a plan to not get caught taking any.

So this glassware heist was a classic four-man job. Two lookouts on the sides blocked the camera and a barkeep's lines of sight. I, the mastermind and wheelman, would reach under the table to hold open my backpack (cut me some slack, I was basically a tourist) and the 4th was our burglar, who would set an empty glass in the bottom when the coast was clear.

We repeated this process until there were, I don't know, maybe 7 or 8 glasses in my bag. The only problem was, to keep getting glasses we had to keep ordering beers to drink, not to mention we only took maybe one glass of every 4 so we wouldn't have an empty table. So obviously we were even farther gone by this point. The person who was taking the glasses had to go de-beer, so another friend of ours sat down in her seat. We explained the plan to him, and he somehow convinced us that he in fact was *not* too drunk to help us. Very comforting. But when all of us were ready, I opened the bag and he held a glass above it. Then suddenly... *SMASH*. He just dropped the fucking glass instead of gently nesting it into another one. So here I am, drunk, surrounded by a bunch of other drunks, with a backpack full of broken glass. Obviously I couldn't just dump it all out, so I decided I had to get out of there. I paid my tab, snuck out, and started walking home.

Then I realized I had no idea where I was. No idea where ""home"" was. No map, no cell phone with service, no idea what my address was. It was my second day in this country, and I didn't even know the language! Even if I could have talked to a local, I wouldn't know what to ask them. I wandered around for what felt like an eternity, but finally found a street that looked familiar, and followed it until I found my building, by some miracle. I stumbled inside, dropped my backpack, and passed out.

When I came to the next morning, memories of the night came flooding back. I checked my backpack and, as karma would have it, it was completely soaked with the smell of stale beer and full of shards of broken glass. To add insult to injury, I found some paperwork that could have guided me home, and that too was soaked.

I felt really guilty about it all, so I somehow mustered up the courage to return to the bar and gave them some money to cover the glasses and a bit more on top. They thought it was sort of funny and appreciated me covering the damages, even though I'm sure they were more angry than they let on and judgemental about me, a stupid tourist, pulling that shit.

We all ended up going back there regularly, but they either never seemed to recognize me after that, or maybe just didn't care.

Tl;dr: got drunk, stole and broke a bunch of Guinness glasses, then got lost in an unfamiliar country.",60
TIFU by accidentally using the N-word,t2_5l780sfq,"This did not happen today, but I just remembered it while writing a comment on Reddit.

Back in around 2010 when I was a foreign student at a US university, I just finished my meal in the cafeteria and was heading out.

On my way out, I saw a buddy of mine, who is African German, tell his friends (all from different African countries) that the Schwarzenegger last name means ""black n..""

It just happened that a few days prior to that I was reading about Schwarzenegger on the internet and it turned out that his last name means black ridge or whatever.

So I dcided to tell them that Schwarzenegger did not mean __that__, and meant something else, and for some reason the stupid teenage me thought it would be ok for me to say the N word because I am not a white American dude and a friend of that guy...

So I say ""Hey man, Schwarzenegger does not mean Black N..., it means black ridge"", and the guy says what?

And I said it __again__ because I thought he just didn't hear me.

He then asked me to fuck off before he beats the shit out of me, even though I immediately started apologizing, because I didn't actually call anyone that, I just repeated his words.

Anyways, after that I understood I shouldn't ise that word at all.

Tl;dr I used the N word thinking it was ok and almost got beaten for it.",5
TIFU by dropping my airpod into my shit filled toilet,t2_12j23mr2,"So around 20 minutes ago I was using my airpod pros on the toilet as one does. I then proceeded to take a dump, a massive, laborious one might I add. No seriously, I might as well have had a midwife help me deliver this thing. Anyhow, while on my phone during said dump, my right airpod fell out of my ear and took a dive towards the toilet. I somehow miraculously caught it in an awkward position between my thighs, but it was in such a way that I pretty much had the airpod pinned against the inside of the toilet seat. Now, as you can imagine, there was practically no way to save the poor thing as there was no room to stick my hand in between my thighs and grab the airpod. So, I hoped, prayed that somehow I could grab the airpod when I pulled my sweaty thighs apart from one another. However, to my horror, the airpod took a plunge into my shit filled toilet. Without thinking, I shoved my entire right hand wrist deep into the toilet and fished the airpod out from a cozy spot laying in between two turds. At this point, I took practically a gallon of hand sanitizer and proceeded to drown the airpod like it was a prisoner being interrogated inside Guantanamo Bay. I made sure to remove the exchangeable tip of the airpod and replace it with a different one that better fits my ear (so I wont have a future disaster on the toilet). It made a loud beeping sound for a little while after, but I let it dry and now it still works fine, no issues so far. I can still feel the sploshing feeling my right hand felt as it nobly sacrificed its poop virginity fishing my airpod out of the toilet, even after washing my hands like fifteen timea. Thankfully, its a bathroom in my own room and im the only one who has used it for over a year now.

TL;DR I dropped my airpod into my shit filled toilet and fished it out wrist deep with my hand",104
