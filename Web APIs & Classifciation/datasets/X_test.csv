1324,i met a stranger without any safety net i know it's hard for people to take me seriously as i live a very open life with my fetishes but open people can get hurt too i met a stranger online without any safety net in place i was struggling with my identity i dressed for years with female clothes but also enjoy my male self i was not a drag queen and i am not transgender i don't know where i fall into i don't really do labels i am just me i like being my alter ego for enjoyment and also to escape when i feel the abuse i endured from childhood it's healing for me to become my alter ego she's female sassy brave and quite fiery all the things my male self is not my male self is quite vulnerable depressed frustrated but yet soft and an animal lover my parents are retirement age so i run most of the farm my father still looks after the cattle he will do that until he dies because his father was the same my maternal grandfather was a horseman so my mother will stick by the horses until she's led on to her final resting place i have a lot of responsibilities on the farm although we have two farmhands it's rare i get a night off so i didn't get time to even think of a safe time to meet the stranger in a safe place or at a safe time i was talking to him for a long time online he liked to crossdress he shared intimate pictures of himself with me i thought because the two of us would be dressed up as females meeting each other that i would be very safe i met him at  at a truck stop a couple miles outside of the farmstead he was waiting by a truck so i assumed this was legit it had the company name on it he was wearing a cape with a hood and had a turban on his head and a face mask i could see his blue eyes so i knew it was him i walked over toward him and he pulled me in toward him for a hug i instantaneously felt safe he whispered to the bathroom so he took my hand and we walked hand in hand toward the facilities i thought it was a bit forward for him to grab my hand but then i thought maybe if i kept holding his hand he would feel comfort too he must have been a bit scared like i after all we both were men dressed as ladies in back country in the am we got into the bathroom and he said want to kiss in the cubicle you look amazing blinded by compliments i went inside the cubicle with him and he took down the hood on his cape and removed his face mask he looked so handsome i noticed that he had no make up on i remember saying that he had the right idea wearing no make up that it took an hour for me to get mine right he headbutted me i felt a huge whack to my skull and i fell backwards toward the lavatory i couldn't even shout i whispered for him to stop he bent me over and hiked up my dress he started to call me derogatory names like sl and bi h he kept repeating that i loved it i felt dizzy from the headbutt and felt a sharp pain i usually use a lot of lubricant during intimate times but he didn't he just pushed himself into me until i blacked out in pain i woke up on the floor of the cubicle with my dress pulled down and a large balding man trying to shake me awake he kept saying miss are you ok miss i know he knew i was male as my wig was missing but i appreciated him so much he looked like a manly man and i was frightened that he would beat me but he lifted me up he took me to the sink and wet a paper towel and asked me to hold it toward my head i had a bump where i was headbutted he walked me outside and he kept asking is there anyone he could call i still felt dizzy and lost for words i started to cry he walked me outside when i went outside i seen the truck where the stranger i met was standing beside and i pointed to it telling the man that's where i met him he man ran over toward the truck in a rage and banged on the truck the door opened and an older gentleman looked startled and bleary eyed words were exchanged and the guy who found me pointed over toward me i could see the older gentleman looking confused i walked over i explained what happened to me that i met stranger by this truck the man said he was sleeping for the past  hours as he was on night shift he drove for  hours straight and needed sleep that there was nobody of the description in or around his truck but he had a cctv style dash cam and he would provide it to the police if i would like to call i cried and begged him not to call the police because i knew the local sheriff he was a friend of my father's and i didn't want to embarrass my father he understood although the man who found me was urging me to report it and he was saying that he'd stay by my side if i wanted i appreciated his kindness so much the older gentleman trucker looked back on the footage on his phone as it is connected to his cell he seen caped stranger had a look at the truck to inspect it and stood at it for at least five minutes before i walked up he had a cellphone in his ear pity we could not hear him converse you can then see i approaching the truck and all that ensued at the truck happening the hug the holding of hands nothing else we do not know where he went or what he did with my wig i thanked the two men and i said i just wanted to go home and forget about it i know it sounds silly but if you were from my neck of the woods you would have the same apprehensions i don't recommend not reporting any assault or attack to the police i feel i was raped i was so thankful and appreciative toward the two men for helping me the guy who found me exchanged his number with me so if i did want to report it he would be be there he text messaged me a couple of times since the incident asking if i was ok and also wishing me a happy christmas and new year i assured him i was and i had support i felt bad for telling lies i didn't want to burden the man because he probably feels traumatised by finding me i didn't realise how bad i looked until i was home i had blood trickling down my legs and a huge bump to my head i had to lie to my parents and say that one of the beef cows bucked me i was a mess my father went into a lecture about safety with the beef cows god bless his soul if only he knew i wouldn't like to disturb my parents they have been through enough with me the court trial with my uncle when i was a youth broke my parents so i could not even begin to bring upon any more judicial events upon them i am still struggling with the rape i found a forum where other people like me had similar experiences at truck stops and warnings i'm sorry i didn't read it sooner or educate myself i was called stupid for going alone and also called ridiculous for not reporting it that stung me more than the attack i did find during my depression and mental breakdown that redditors helped me though i am so greatful for this site so greatful i just want to share the dangers i just want you to ignore all else about me from my kinks to my post history as i know it may distract from what i am trying to bring forward here i want you all to be careful go into the new year helping each other i nearly lost my life in  in two ways one being attacked and then the suicide attempt that followed the attack lots of love here is to a positive  i am hoping i find my peace i crave so much i'm in tears now after writing this but heck if it helps someone be safe that's all that matt,i met a stranger without any safety net

729,the crazy way i hired a hooker nsfw long post but trust me it gets good so about six years ago i was sixteen and horny as hell my attempts at finding girlfriends had not worked so i decided screw it i'm hiring a hooker my first idea was to try craigslist but the prices were too high i then decided to try in hire a hooker off the streets of chicago which was relatively close driving distanse eventually the stars aligned and my parents left a car at home when they traveled too see a friend's weeding the only issue was i didn't have a license yet but i didn't want to let this opportunity slip by so i went for it now i didn't go into this quite as unprepared as you might think what i did was using a reddit post which gave a map of the prostitutuon arrests in chicago as well as site which i probably can't mention has guide in its name if you know what i'm talking about i figured out the locations where streetwalkers frequent south cicero ave west garfield park  ave were a couple of places to minimize the chance of a sting my idea was to ask the streetwalker if she would like a ride since that would not be incriminating and the cops normally won't risk getting into the car for something this petty i was confident it would be smooth sailing so i got in the car and drove about  minutes to chicago i then went to the areas were i thought the hookers were and drove in a circuit around there now of course then it hits me that i'm a white kid from the subers driving in the worst areas of chicago not to offend anyone but some of these areas are  percent plus black if a white guy is in the area everyone knows it is to buy drugs or sex i did not have a liscense so if the coos pulled me over i was screwed also there was a not insignificant chance of being robbed and or assaulted i drove around south cicero ave for like hours and saw no hooker i was willing to pay for finally at like  in the morning i was about ready to go home when i spotted a decent looking black girl who was obviously a streetwalker she was a  out of ten at best kinda fat but a model compared to what else was on offer things were looking up i cracked open my window a bit and asked if she would like a ride of course she then gets a very confused look on her face and says you want a bj of course now i'm paranoid that this a sting but the girl looked the part so i went for it i said yes l and she got in the car i negotiated a bj and full service for  dollars all bare but i had to pull out for the full service of course then it hits me that i have no idea where i'm at i spent a good ten minutes trying to find a spot to park my car and eventually settled on a worringly well traveled alley i don't want to get to graphic but the sex itself was what you would expect the bj was a bit toothy but alright the full service was okay her pussy smelled a bit funny and i may have not pulled out quite in in time but i finished so i got my money's worth also some guy walked by right in the middle of the bj which was bit weird but i was focused so after the sex i dropped her off about a block away now at this point things were going well but i got greedy i had enough cash left to hire another streetwalker so why not find another so i'm driving around looking at my phone trying to figure out where i should go next and in a very stupid moment missed a stop sign and hit some lady's suv i saw here right before i hit here and manged to slow down a lot so the damage appeared to be minimal still i was totally screwed i had no driver liscense had technically stolen the car i was driving and i had just crashed into a lady so in an admittedly dick move i drove onto the shoulder to get around her car and gunned it i was able to drive off fairly fast and i hoped no witness or cameras saw my liscense plate as i drove further away i was pretty panicked at this point but knew my best option was to hope luck was on my side and drive home right away my driving was terrible i was so flustered that i was driving like  under the speed limit and even got lost on my home i managed to get home without being pulled over when i got home i was so paranoid that the cops would come that i actually tires to find the incident report for the hit an run on the police website and tired to figure out a way to check if i had any warrants never did find anything and thankfully for me nothing ever come of it at this point the statute of limitations has expired the damage to the car i was driving was not very noticeable and since it was poc i doubt my parents noticed so somehow in the end i got away with everything and got to have sex with a hooker the std test even came back negative sometimes it's better to be lucky than good,the crazy way i hired a hooker nsfw long post but

482, by not checking the name on my package so my wife and i recently decided to try a few new things to spice up our intimacy during covid i don't often buy lingerie for her but when i do i usually get it from victoria's secret or a place that's near our house because of covid i decided to try buying her a few items from amazon instead i went kind of crazy and purchased about  pieces of lingerie a very realistic dildo and a butt plug i was ready for a great weekend i was sitting at my home office a few days later and got a notification that the delivery was a few stops away it was pouring and i didn't want the package to get soaked so i went to the door and greeted the delivery guy as he fumbled around a bunch of packages and handed me mine i set the package on the table to dry while i finished up my work and few minutes later i got the a gut twisting text hey we're expecting a bunch of deliveries from amazon today and accidentally opened one of yours that was accidentally delivered to us sorry i read this text that was between me my wife my neighbor and his mother and felt my heart drop i quickly went to amazon to see if it could have possibly been a different package that was delivered to my neighbor but no the most intimate private package that i have ever had sent to me was delivered to the wrong address and of course it was opened it was the perfect storm i then went to check the package that i set on the table and realized that sure enough it was addressed to my neighbor had i noticed this when the package was delivered you wouldn't be reading this story in an attempt to comfort myself i thought well maybe the lingerie inside the package just looks like clothes i had to do the awkward exchange to find out i dropped the package on my neighbors porch and responded to his text to let him know about the mix up and he brought mine over shortly after luckily it was still raining so there was a good excuse to not share any dialog other than sorry about that i brought the package into the house and set the box on the dining room table and opened up the two flaps that had obviously been previously opened the first thing i see is a massive penis looking dildo in a clear hard plastic tube right next to it the stacked lingerie with a label on the top that read schoolgirl lingerie set the butt plug was nestled in the corner but it was easy enough to see anyways my neighbor and i have not spoken about this awkward occurrence and i certainly don't plan to word of advice if you ever buy lingerie or anything else that is private online make sure the delivery driver delivers it to the right house if it's at all possible also check your packages and make sure they're delivered to you tl dr bought a bunch of sex stuff online it got delivered to my neighbor by accident and my neighbor opened it up and obviously saw inside my sick kinky mind, by not checking the name on my package so my wife and i recently decided to try a few new

110, by drawing a swastika disclaimer ok i have been wondering for a few weeks now if i should post this i even thought about doing it on an alt account because i don't know how people will react but fuck it i'm going hardcore keep in mind that i'm very against war the nazi movement the holocaust and anything related to those this happened somewhere between  and  i was  back then and i wasn't even a stupid kid i was actually kinda smart but never had any interest in wars and i hadn't learned anything about ww2 in school so i knew nothing about nazis hitler or anything that happened i had just receive a laptop a year ago it actually belonged to my mom but she didn't use it eventually i joined a forum where i met this girl we started an online relationship which i regret today but as a kid with no maturity being in a relationship was pretty tempting anyway she broke my heart in a messed up way after we started dating she suddenly disappeared for  months one day i find out she came back and was dating a guy that was my friend on that same forum having no one to talk to about it i decided to just write it all on paper my parents were against me talking to strangers online so i didn't want them to see the letter so i had to hide it i don't usually have posters on my room but at that time i had one poster about a sonic game on my wall i decided to hide the letter behind that poster for some reason i was really good at turning a piece of paper into an envelope with some origami trickery magic whatever so i made an envelope put the letter inside it but the envelope was too simple so i decided to decorate it and stupid me realized you know what this weird symbol swastika looks pretty sick so i drew it on the envelope a few weeks passed and one day my mom was cleaning my bedroom she hit the poster and the envelope fell down my mom is the kind of parent that respects my privacy so she didn't open the letter back then i was pretty relieved because she didn't read it she would get so pissed off if she knew i was talking to strangers online during my adolescence i never understood why my mom sometimes said she was scared of me until recently when it finally struck me it was because she saw the envelope and she thought that i was some sort of neo nazi or whatever i kinda wish she had read the letter now tldr stupid me as a kid wrote a letter about a girl i met online my parents would kill me if they knew i talked to strangers online so i hid it inside an envelope and drew a swastika on it because i didn't know what it was and i just thought it looked cool my mom found out and she didn't read the letter inside so she was scared of me during my adolesc, by drawing a swastika disclaimer ok i have been wondering for a few weeks now if i should post this i even

475, by buying an f/4 camera lens as a brit to preface i'm a photographer who mostly uses a small pocket camera sony rx100 and a dslr only for bigger jobs i'm not a big fan of mirrorless anyway i was getting bored of using my rx100 and missed the large viewfinders the battery life and everything else that came with dslr's but my only dslr was a canon  iv which is way too big and heavy to carry around so my christmas gift to myself was the canon  w/ ef   f/4l i was a little skeptical of getting a lens with a maximum aperture of  my sony is   if you don't know what that means f l / d where l focal length of lens and d diameter of the front element of the lens the lower the number the more light the lens lets in but i realized i never really used f/1  on my rx100 unless it's really dark i'm a pixel peeper with self diagnosed ocd and the zeiss lens at   is a little soft so i mostly used f/4  so i opened the lens and camera on christmas day the lens had some scuffs which knocked it down in value the camera some signs of use but very well looked after with low shutter count both are fantastic the problem i've been bringing the camera/lens out on essential days but literally everyday it's been overcast and raining and i'm forced to use a max aperture of f/4 the pictures either come out grainy due to high iso or blurry or underexposed and i'm pretty sure i have some form of seasonal affective disorder which means i have no inspiration and have taken a few hundred photos only a handful have actually been decent enough for my portfolio the rest is blurry or just me testing it out i also overestimated the high iso noise performance my rx100 deals with noise fantastically and even then it's only nice monochromatic and there's still info in the shadows the canon though has horid chromatic noise hot pixels and no info in the shadows on a bright sunny day it's a great combo if i was one of those stereotypes living on the west coast of the usa in sunny ca i'm sure i'd be getting some great pictures of my vw camper and the palm trees at the beach while cranking the vibrance up high for those cyan blue skies at shutter speeds of  at f/8 with iso  but no i'm a brit with typical british weather trying to get atleast a decent macro shot of a raindrop on a window at  of a second at iso   hoping f/4 is good enough to make matters worse i bought myself a cheap nd filter set because i envisioned doing photography on a sunny day they haven't seen a single bit of use yet i'm considering getting an ef  f/1  stm tl dr i'm a photographer who was bored of shooting with a pocket camera so i bought a decent used dslr and f/4 lens as my christmas gift only to find out it doesn't let in enough light for overcast rainy british days i have barely used it and i'm

588, by accidentally creating a false bomb threat causing the entire school to go on lockdown as is tradition this happened about thirteen years ago and i am on mobile i attended an exceedingly poorly run middle school where the administration decided the best response to kids fighting/throwing food in the cafeteria was to make everyone wait outside for the first lunch shift to clear out the cafeteria before the next lunch shift could enter anyone who has worked with middle schoolers knows corralling them is like herding cats and the lunch shifts were severely understaffed so kids would lolly gag in the cafeteria to avoid going to class and hold up the lunch shifts this meant that by the last lunch shift we spent   of our half hour lunch waiting outside in the texas heat my best friend jasper and i got bored waiting for lunch and being the massive geeks that we are decided to re enact potter puppet pals specifically the mysterious ticking noise i now despise jk rowling s terf stances anti semitism and cultural appropriation and the irony of two closeted trans kids being her biggest fans at the time is not lost on me as many of you probably know this episode involves very obnoxious puppets singing about snape only to be interrupted by a mysterious ticking which turns out to be a pipe bomb now potter puppet pals wasn t exactly standard fare in our part of texas and most of our peers were quiet bewildered by the two oddly dressed kids putting on very poor british accents and jumping around but they were used to our strange antics at this point and payed us no mind by

too concerned as kids had brought in drugs before and was happy to bury my nose in my fantasy novel at the end of the day the school passed out letters for our parents explaining a student overheard two other students talking about a bomb and the school was placed on lockdown i quickly put two and two together realizing someone overheard our little rendition of the mysterious ticking noise and reported it to a teacher apparently they either felt the need to finish their meager school lunch first or the lunch monitor couldn t be bothered with it until the next period i panicked as i was generally an anxious kid and we were in the height of the late  zero tolerance movement thinking i would be expelled if anyone realized jasper and i were the cause of the bomb threat jasper being

1264,three years ago i abandoned my son after my divorce warning long post this is essentially a diary entry to get this off my chest for the new year tl dr my depression spiralled out of control after my son turned  i lost hair lost weight lost my mind and after multiple attempts to find solutions i divorced my husband and gave my son up for kinship adoption to my sister in law i later moved across the country and am starting to rekindle my relationship with my ex adam and i were married for eight years and together for twelve we spent half of that time together trying for a baby i had  miscarriages it was horrible and traumatizing but i wanted a baby i wanted to experience pregnancy and labour and i didn't give one shit about adopting a child i wanted this we stopped trying until the spring of  when we went on an anniversary trip i didn't know it but i came home pregnant by july i found out that i was three months nearly four and i was over the moon this was it this was our time and all the stars were aligning i spent the next six months puking my brains out flinching whenever someone touched me and absolutely repulsed by any intimacy from my then husband but i was still happy still excited and still enjoying every moment of having that life inside me reverently documenting every moment of the journey my mom made the joke that we would have the best baby ever since the idea is a bad pregnancy produces an angelic baby and a great pregnancy produces a demon i laughed at it and never thought of it again until i had lucas in my arms six months later a year later i was suicidal and rapidly losing weight lucas was a monster he screamed constantly but he didn't like to be held he hated playing peekaboo games and he wasn't reaching his milestones my mother berated me constantly and blamed his behaviour on my inability to breastfeed my in laws speculated that i had been drinking or smoking during pregnancy right to my face during this year adam and i took our separate bedrooms to the next level he moved into the basement his sister sam was the only person that i felt i could talk to but even then i worried she would report back to her brother all of my horrible thought we fought about who should stay home because i wanted to go back to work but living where we did we either needed a nanny or one of us to be home when the other wasn't able to i spent my days crying and eventually got back to smoking pot in the hopes it would mellow me out sam offered to help if we moved to her province but my husband didn't want to move his practice and i was happy where we were at the urging of my ex and my doctors i joined parental groups and drove the hour to the nearby city to talk to other parents of autistic kids all these people did was talk about how rewarding it was to raise their kids how much easier it was than they ever expected and how they didn't understand the stigma one mother raved about the amazing moment her seventeen year old spoke for the first time he said yes please i was horrified i felt like a fucking monster lucas was approaching two now he was nearly a toddler and he acted more like a six month old and that was being generous but a woman from my group sandra and i seemed to get on well when she too joined around this time and she expressed her sorrow for feeling like a failure we exchanged numbers and got together often sharing horror stories of finding the kids covered in god knows what hitting us whenever they were touched and the constant care they required that other kids didn't adam was happy we were having sex again i had friends i'd stopped losing hair and everything was good sam visited and for a brief moment i felt normal with a normal family i felt like maybe i could do this after all that i had just overreacted and then lucas's second birthday came around sandra brought her son over and her husband the guys watched the kids while she and i polished off three bottles of wine oh i wouldn't trade travis for anything she gushed it's hard but i love him it gets easier i would totally do it all over again i laughed and winked over my glass you're better than me because i'd say fuck that and go about my business what do you mean i'd get an abortion i wouldn't want to do this again she was quiet obviously and i'd clearly stuck my foot in my mouth she and her family left a few hours later after cake and bbq and she wouldn't return any of my texts or calls for several weeks eventually she texted me back to say that she thought i was someone else and would prefer i don't contact her again i cried for days i was completely gutted and at my lowest point i screamed this is your fault at lucas when he was having one of his meltdowns adam came running and took lucas to his room when he came back he told me i needed therapy and that we couldn't keep having these problems i spent the next six months at my parent's place on the east coast i was glad to be away and as the phrase goes absence makes the heart grow fonder adam and i were on the mends and chatting with each other constantly he didn't offer up information about lucas unless i asked which i only did when prompted by my parents he told me he had a nanny while i was gone and it might be good to keep her there when i came back i agreed and packed my bags to go home several months later lucas was worse when i came back he was bigger he was louder he would shove his hands into his diaper and smear his shit all over himself and then start screaming because he didn't like it when he learned this behaviour upset me he would do it to avoid having me feed him while out in public and any other time he felt like it he became more violent as he got older as toddlers often do and i found myself less and less attached to him during this sam stopped calling and reached out to the nanny get updates on lucas i considered the loss of our friendship collateral for my mental health improving my ex and i were basically never home we hired two other nannies to take shifts and went about our days happily pretending that he didn't exist until we inevitably had to go back our sex life thrived and we even got back into old habits roleplaying strangers and meeting somewhere before going back to a hotel we got lazy we stopped caring about precautions and just after lucas's third birthday i found out i was pregnant with baby number two adam held me while i cried and drove me to the hospital for the abortion i guess that had been the honeymoon phase because when we came home things plummeted i blamed lucas for feeling like i had to get an abortion not wanting to subject another person to this life i stopped asking the nannies about how he was one of them made small talk with me one day and started talking about him i changed the subject and later that week when she did it again i told her i didn't care she stopped talking about him and happily told me about her and her boyfriend instead i was thankful to not have to pretend this continued for several weeks until i eventually confronted adam head on i don't want to do this anymore i told him while we were out with lucas i know okay i don't know what you need me to say i can't fix this i don't expect you to and i know you don't want to do this either adam didn't say anything and we slowly began the process of separation i moved out of the house cut contact with my in laws and even my own family i was completely secluded i don't know how the topic came up but while talking about the divorce sam came to visit and take over my role and that of the nannies i researched a lot during the divorce about custody our obligations and what would happen since our prenup specified me retaining majority custody and the house but i wanted neither my lawyer upon hearing about sam's attachment suggested kinship adoption i shrugged it off signed my papers and left the province leaving adam the house and the kid i came back eight months later when adam called and told me he wanted to go through with the kinship adoption to his sister our rights were signed over and he gave her the house my life improved substantially since then i completed my master's degree got my tubes tied and took my grandmother's maiden name to remove myself completely i ve never been happier but i ve been reminiscent of adam since quarantine started he must have been thinking of me too because he contacted me on halloween i invited him for christmas he flew in quarantined and has been staying with me since sometimes i feel guilty but right now watching him sleep and listening to the music playing from his phone i m reminded of how happy he makes me we re better off i was a terrible mother and i got out names have been changed edit i copied and pasted this after writing it over several days i didn t realize that reddit would jumble it so badly so there is missing info from me doing a last minute edit after it was posted my older brother is autistic but lives on his own has a career and an education i naively thought this experience had me prepared for anything especially because adam was older than me and this is a known potential issue with older fathers my doctors chalked my miscarriages up to stress from my depression and being off my medication while trying to get pregnant i have bipolar ii and had gone off all medications in the hopes of giving my baby the best chance lucas did have therapy and all sorts of treatment i constantly brought him to the city and eventually we switched to having a specialist do in house visits because he was getting bigger and harder to cart around i don t absolve myself i feel a lot of regret and pain but for his well being and mine it s best not to have contact sam is his mother like me she really wanted kids but was never able to because she s not married or in any relationship she was having a hard time trying to adopt she latched onto lucas from the beginning and i often joked that she was his second mum he could not be in better hands yes adam and i have money i have inheritance and he is a psychiatrist with his own practice we both send sam money and the house is paid for but neither of us has contact with lucas adam hasn t since we signed the paperwork on the adoption and i haven t since the divorce was finalized my abortion wasn t because i thought i would have another autistic kid i didn t want to have a neurotypical child and bring that up in that environment watching me hate myself and eventually lucas i had these horrible thoughts that i would love one more than the other and neither of them deserved that yes this post focuses on me not because i m self centred but because my confession is about me leaving my family behind it s not about lucas that s not my story to write adam is thinking of moving his practice or trying to get work at a local hospital right now he plans to stay for a few more weeks edit  i cannot express all of my gratitude for those that understand and the well wishes i understand the angry comments i do but all i want people to understand is that it s not important for lucas and i to be reunited just because i m his biological mother his mother is sam and on some level i think she always has been lucas deserves sam and i will forever be indebted to her for giving him the stable life that i and adam couldn t for his benefit i will not re enter his life it s not fair to him for me to pop in and out at my convenience i appreciate the photos sam sends me but unless lucas progresses to a point where he can specifically ask for me i don t want to push into his lif,three years ago i abandoned my son after my divorce warning long post this is essentially a diary entry to get this off my chest for the new year tl dr my depression

home when the other wasn't able to i spent my days crying and eventually got back to smoking pot in the hopes it would mellow me out sam offered to help if we moved to her province but my husband didn't want to move his practice and i was happy where we were at the urging of my ex and my doctors i joined parental groups and drove the hour to the nearby city to talk to other parents of autistic kids all these people did was talk about how rewarding it was to raise their kids how much easier it was than they ever expected and how they didn't understand the stigma one mother raved about the amazing moment her seventeen year old spoke for the first time he said yes please i was horrified i felt like a fucking monster lucas was approaching two now he was nearly a toddler and he acted more like a six month old and that was being generous but a woman from my group sandra and i seemed to get on well when she too joined around this time and she expressed her sorrow for feeling like a failure we exchanged numbers and got together often sharing horror stories of finding the kids covered in god knows what hitting us whenever they were touched and the constant care they required that other kids didn't adam was happy we were having sex again i had friends i'd stopped losing hair and everything was good sam visited and for a brief moment i felt normal with a normal family i felt like maybe i could do this after all that i had just overreacted and then lucas's second birthday came around sandra brought her son over and her husband the guys watched the kids while she and i polished off three bottles of wine oh i wouldn't trade travis for anything she gushed it's hard but i love him it gets easier i would totally do it all over again i laughed and winked over my glass you're better than me because i'd say fuck that and go about my business what do you mean i'd get an abortion i wouldn't want to do this again she was quiet obviously and i'd clearly stuck my foot in my mouth she and her family left a few hours later after cake and bbq and she wouldn't return any of my texts or calls for several weeks eventually she texted me back to say that she thought i was someone else and would prefer i don't contact her again i cried for days i was completely gutted and at my lowest point i screamed this is your fault at lucas when he was having one of his meltdowns adam came running and took lucas to his room when he came back he told me i needed therapy and that we couldn't keep having these problems i spent the next six months at my parent's place on the east coast i was glad to be away and as the phrase goes absence makes the heart grow fonder adam and i were on the mends and chatting with each other constantly he didn't offer up information about lucas unless i asked which i only did when prompted by my parents he told me he had a nanny while i was gone and it might be good to keep her there when i came back i agreed and packed my bags to go home several months later lucas was worse when i came back he was bigger he was louder he would shove his hands into his diaper and smear his shit all over himself and then start screaming because he didn't like it when he learned this behaviour upset me he would do it to avoid having me feed him while out in public and any other time he felt like it he became more violent as he got older as toddlers often do and i found myself less and less attached to him during this sam stopped calling and reached out to the nanny get updates on lucas i considered the loss of our friendship collateral for my mental health improving my ex and i were basically never home we hired two other nannies to take shifts and went about our days happily pretending that he didn't exist until we inevitably had to go back our sex life thrived and we even got back into old habits roleplaying strangers and meeting somewhere before going back to a hotel we got lazy we stopped caring about precautions and just after lucas's third birthday i found out i was pregnant with baby number two adam held me while i cried and drove me to the hospital for the abortion i guess that had been the honeymoon phase because when we came home things plummeted i blamed lucas for feeling like i had to get an abortion not wanting to subject another person to this life i stopped asking the nannies about how he was one of them made small talk with me one day and started talking about him i changed the subject and later that week when she did it again i told her i didn't care she stopped talking about him and happily told me about her and her boyfriend instead i was thankful to not have to pretend this continued for several weeks until i eventually confronted adam head on i don't want to do this anymore i told him while we were out with lucas i know okay i don't know what you need me to say i can't fix this i don't expect you to and i know you don't want to do this either adam didn't say anything and we slowly began the process of separation i moved out of the house cut contact with my in laws and even my own family i was completely secluded i don't know how the topic came up but while talking about the divorce sam came to visit and take over my role and that of the nannies i researched a lot during the divorce about custody our obligations and what would happen since our prenup specified me retaining majority custody and the house but i wanted neither my lawyer upon hearing about sam's attachment suggested kinship adoption i shrugged it off signed my papers and left the province leaving adam the house and the kid i came back eight months later when adam called and told me he wanted to go through with the kinship adoption to his sister our rights were signed over and he gave her the house my life improved substantially since then i completed my master's degree got my tubes tied and took my grandmother's maiden name to remove myself completely i ve never been happier but i ve been reminiscent of adam since quarantine started he must have been thinking of me too because he contacted me on halloween i invited him for christmas he flew in quarantined and has been staying with me since sometimes i feel guilty but right now watching him sleep and listening to the music playing from his phone i m reminded of how happy he makes me we re better off i was a terrible mother and i got out names have been changed edit i copied and pasted this after writing it over several days i didn t realize that reddit would jumble it so badly so there is missing info from me doing a last minute edit after it was posted my older brother is autistic but lives on his own has a career and an education i naively thought this experience had me prepared for anything especially because adam was older than me and this is a known potential issue with older fathers my doctors chalked my miscarriages up to stress from my depression and being off my medication while trying to get pregnant i have bipolar ii and had gone off all medications in the hopes of giving my baby the best chance lucas did have therapy and all sorts of treatment i constantly brought him to the city and eventually we switched to having a specialist do in house visits because he was getting bigger and harder to cart around i don t absolve myself i feel a lot of regret and pain but for his well being and mine it s best not to have contact sam is his mother like me she really wanted kids but was never able to because she s not married or in any relationship she was having a hard time trying to adopt she latched onto lucas from the beginning and i often joked that she was his second mum he could not be in better hands yes adam and i have money i have inheritance and he is a psychiatrist with his own practice we both send sam money and the house is paid for but neither of us has contact with lucas adam hasn t since we signed the paperwork on the adoption and i haven t since the divorce was finalized my abortion wasn t because i thought i would have another autistic kid i didn t want to have a neurotypical child and bring that up in that environment watching me hate myself and eventually lucas i had these horrible thoughts that i would love one more than the other and neither of them deserved that yes this post focuses on me not because i m self centred but because my confession is about me leaving my family behind it s not about lucas that s not my story to write adam is thinking of moving his practice or trying to get work at a local hospital right now he plans to stay for a few more weeks edit  i cannot express all of my gratitude for those that understand and the well wishes i understand the angry comments i do but all i want people to understand is that it s not important for lucas and i to be reunited just because i m his biological mother his mother is sam and on some level i think she always has been lucas deserves sam and i will forever be indebted to her for giving him the stable life that i and adam couldn t for his benefit i will not re enter his life it s not fair to him for me to pop in and out at my convenience i appreciate the photos sam sends me but unless lucas progresses to a point where he can specifically ask for me i don t want to push into his life

1151,who's the psychopath let me tell you a story you may find it boring or maybe not your cup of tea so i won't beg you to stay and read if you don't want to but if you do read this thank you there was once a kid who had big dreams his mom was a teacher and his dad worked in management in an insurance company the kid always loved his parents one day when the kid was  the kid misplaced the annual report card he got from his teacher a few minutes ago his mother grabbed his collar yanked it and squeezed his neck in front of the entire school the kid didn't care then a few years later his mom started working in the same school as him one day when they were late to school his mother yanked his ear in front of the entire school in the morning assembly the kid didn't care then a few years after that one day the kid swore at another and his mom also his english teacher at school got to know about it she asked if he knew what the swear word meant and he clearly didn't she slapped him in front of the entire class the kid didn't care then his mother looking at him always used to yell at his face she always wanted a girl at least then she could help her with chores the kid started caring another day she called her kid immature in front of his entire class in school the kid started caring one day the kid's mom yelled that their kid was the result of a thousand sins in past lives the kid started caring the kid started losing his emotional attachments with his parents especially with his mom once there was a time when the mom threatened to leave the house and family for good the kid would cry his liver out then but now he didn't have much feelings who is to blame here a  year old kid who made an honest mistake or someone who choked him until other parents stopped her a typical modern day laid back teenager or a mother who constantly yelled she'd have preferred a girl over her boy a boy who was just trying to live a normal life or a mom who told him he was the result of sins a boy who wanted to pursue his dreams or his mother who told him he'll live homeless begging for food if the mom wanted her kid to be mature was she mature to choke her kid in front of an entire school a kid who didn't know the meaning of what he said or a mother who slapped her kid for using a swear word a word which she often used herself a kid who was merely living out of her sight to avoid drama or a mother who constantly told him she wanted a girl in place of him a kid who wanted to make his passion his dream or a mother who told him he'll live homeless if he does so if the mother was an adult shouldn't she be responsible for everything she said doesn't responsibility come with adulthood and yet she wanted her son to be mature on the positive side the mother and the father always provided the best for their son was she right was she a good parent could the constant emotional bombardment subdue the facilities they always provided did she ever understand her son

469, by not showering with my best friend obligatory not today this happened  years ago but i only realised today it was a fuck up i  was talking to my husband  about the differences between girl friendships and boy friendships mainly we were discussing that girls are generally more physically affectionate with each other than boys are i decided to bring up an example about the best friend i had when i was  until  we would spoon watching films hold hands cuddle asleep during sleepovers etc then i mentioned we would practise kissing each other so we'd be experts whenever we kissed boys at this point my husband stopped me to say that that's not friendly affection it's worth pointing out that i am bisexual so for some reason i somehow assumed he was saying i couldn't have been affectionate with my friend because of this i began defending it no no it wasn't like that and then went on to prove it by saying we even used to take turns showering together and the other would just chill in the bathroom chatting with us he was baffled by this and asked why i didnt really have an answer other than whenever i was at her house and we had the place to ourselves she'd always want to try a new face mask or hair dye/product and while we initially would take turns showering she suggested we both just stay in the room to keep each other company eta i swear thought i'd mentioned this but apparently not when she suggested the shower thing she initially said we should shower together to save water and time since we could help wash each others hair etc i'd panicked and kind of babbled excuses about oh we wouldn't both fit and it would be just as quick to wait for the other to finish hence why we ended up sitting in the bathroom while the other showered then swapping i then pointed out she knew i was bi and i'd never wanted her to feel uncomfortable so i'd always made sure when she was showering to look away and if she asked me to look over for any reason i would completely maintain eye contact the entire time which to me proved it was nothing romantic at all i pointed out how difficult i found the entire experience because i'd had a massive crush on her and she'd always made jokes about how we didnt need boys because we had each other/ she wished we could just live together and make out all the time which just made the crush worse anyway after some back and forth with my husband who at this point was crying with laughter after i'd explained how hard it was to maintain the eye contact since often she'd ask me to look at stretch marks/freckles/ends of her hair he finally got me to realise she was very likely trying to sleep with me and i'd been so worried about revealing my crush and ruining our friendship i hadnt noticed tldr was so scared of

since often she'd ask me to look at stretch marks/freckles/ends of her hair he finally got me to realise she was very likely trying to sleep with me and i'd been so worried about revealing my crush and ruining our friendship i hadnt noticed tldr was so scared of friend finding out about my crush i didnt realise she may have been trying to seduce me

131, by inhaling ants this happened a few years ago i was traveling in nepal with a group from my college we were spending about  weeks helping out at a school there doing teaching construction agriculture stuff and whatever else needed to be done public education in the area wasn t very good so this school was considered a sort of tuition free private school in order to function it ran largely on volunteers from both the surrounding area and from around the world for volunteers who didn t live in the area there was a large shared bunkhouse of sorts the bunkhouse was made out of mud bricks and had two floors it had windows but the windows didn t have glass in them so rats bugs etc could be an issue sometimes it was also just generally pretty grimy the first day we get there i pick a sleeping spot near one of the windows i set all of my stuff down and unpack a little including a small toiletry bag i use to hold my toothbrush and medications when i m traveling the windowsill is pretty wide and makes a good shelf so i set the toiletry bag down there fast forward to that evening it s about  and we had all been sitting and chatting around a campfire for most of the evening i had a bad cold and had run out of tissues so i figured it was time to go to bed i went upstairs in the bunkhouse grabbed my toiletry bag and brought it back outside to a little external sink area to brush my teeth and do my meds i have pretty bad asthma so i take an inhaled corticosteroid twice a day at this point i just do it on autopilot before brushing my teeth i m standing outside at the sink wearing a headlamp so i can roughly see what i m doing and take my inhaler as i breath in i feel a couple small somethings fly into my mouth i don t think it s a huge deal because every so often a

bed as soon as possible and instead of freaking out like i would have thought i handle the situation surprisingly logically i give a couple good coughs to make sure any ants are out of my lungs and

321, by saying the right thing to the wrong person admittedly this happened about  years ago and after telling a friend this story she encouraged me to share it with you fine fucker uppers i'm writing this from my phone so excuse any poor formatting and/or waffling on going back about  years and i was working at the local garage as a tyre fitter/mechanic the work was pretty mindless but the guys i worked with were all good value and we all got along really well we still occasionally catch up and i still cope a bit of flak for this fuck up anyway one morning before i got there someone had dropped in a set of  brand new wheels to have  new tyres fitted my boss a bit of a hardass who owned the shop and also another across town asked me to have it done within the hour because the person who owned the wheels would be back in to have them fitted to the car at about x time piece of cake as i'm fitting the tyres i admire the wheels that i'm working on they were genuine forged wheels about  wide with a deep dish and looked extremely expensive so i thought somehow i will compliment the owner on his choice of wheels when i see him i finished fitting the tyres and move onto the next job fast forward a little bit and i have to leave the store to go get parts for said next job when i return there is a different car on my hoist and a colleague had already removed the wheels he let me know that this was the vehicle that was to have the brand new wheels fitted and that the customer was in the waiting room i got right to work within about  it was done and i drove the car off the hoist and into the carpark my work colleague and i both remarked on how good the car looked with it's new feet i thought now's my chance to go and compliment the customer on his choice of wheels we both go into the waiting room where there is only one customer sitting and the first thing i said to him was far out mate those wheels looks great they must have cost you an arm and a leg i have never seen someone's facial expression change so fast complete elation to explosive anger in a fraction of a second my colleague gaps it out of the room as he obviously sensed the impeding doom whilst i am none the wiser then the abuse began you're a real funny fucker aren't you must think you're real cool taking the mick out of someone else's misfortune go get your boss before i punch your fucking lights out etc etc etc this went on for about a minute i locked up not knowing what to say or do because i had no idea what i'd done i stutter a bunch but eventually do what he said and i went to go get my boss who by this point had heard the swearing and yelling and knew something was up he told me to go make a cup of coffee and he'll see if he can get to the bottom of it i go to the break room where i find my colleague doubled over in the corner wetting himself with uncontrollable laughter he's trying to tell me something but can't get the words out in between bouts of hysterics eventually he gets it across that dude he was in a motorbike accident a while ago he's got a prosthetic leg and a false arm then once again breaking out in hysterics the significance of this didn't quite dawn on me until i recounted what i had initially said to him my heart sunk and i felt like the biggest piece of shit all the while my work mate thinks it is literally the funniest thing he has ever witnessed as it turns out the guy was so mad because he had told my colleague about his accident earlier assumed we were all aware of his disability/situation and therefore my comment about paying for his wheels with an arm and leg was me making a premeditated malicious joke at his expense fuccccckkkkkk customer grudgingly paid his bill left the shop unhappy vowing to never come back and then wrote a

now's my chance to go and compliment the customer on his choice of wheels we both go into the waiting room where there is only one customer sitting and the first thing i said to him was far out mate those wheels looks great they must have cost you an arm and a leg i have never seen someone's facial expression change so fast complete elation to explosive anger in a fraction of a second my colleague gaps it out of the room as he obviously sensed the impeding doom whilst i am none the wiser then the abuse began you're a real funny fucker aren't you must think you're real cool taking the mick out of someone else's misfortune go get your boss before i punch your fucking lights out etc etc etc this went on for about a minute i locked up not knowing what to say or do because i had no idea what i'd done i stutter a bunch but eventually do what he said and i went to go get my boss who by this point had heard the swearing and yelling and knew something was up he told me to go make a cup of coffee and he'll see if he can get to the bottom of it i go to the break room where i find my colleague doubled over in the corner wetting himself with uncontrollable laughter he's trying to tell me something but can't get the words out in between bouts of hysterics eventually he gets it across that dude he was in a motorbike accident a while ago he's got a prosthetic leg and a false arm then once again breaking out in hysterics the significance of this didn't quite dawn on me until i recounted what i had initially said to him my heart sunk and i felt like the biggest piece of shit all the while my work mate thinks it is literally the funniest thing he has ever witnessed as it turns out the guy was so mad because he had told my colleague about his accident earlier assumed we were all aware of his disability/situation and therefore my comment about paying for his wheels with an arm and leg was me making a premeditated malicious joke at his expense fuccccckkkkkk customer grudgingly paid his bill left the shop unhappy vowing to never come back and then wrote a bad review on google i got a barrelling from my boss about paying more attention but mostly the vibe from it was shit happens get back to work and make me more money tl/dr unknowingly made fun of a disabled person got the company i work for a bad google review still feel terrible

442, by driving my new to me car background i  have been learning to drive i have my learners permit so my caring yet cheap dad decided to get me a car i knew that he wasn t going to get me a new car and i didn t expect him to but the car  honda civic hybrid he bought was in really rough condition the main problem was that the transmission needed to be replaced he finally finished replacing it this weekend he got the license plate this afternoon and i was thrilled because i would finally be able to drive it the main reason i even needed a car was so i could drive it to my youth orchestra rehearsals i usually drive my sister s car but she gets home from school later than i need to leave for rehearsal so i am almost always late by just a few minutes now that i had my own car i could leave earlier and i wouldn t have to worry or so i thought fast forward to about   this afternoon my dad and i are getting ready to leave i still have to have an adult in the car with me when i drive because i only have my learners permit rehearsal starts at   and it takes about  minutes to get there but traffic is usually pretty heavy so it takes longer my dad originally wanted to leave around   but he needed to stop by the bank so we left at   i start the car up and back up the driveway so that i can get to the road the first thing i notice is the terrifying rumbling and shaking that occurs when i put the car in reverse my dad said it was fine so we went out onto the road the next thing i noticed was how bumpy it was again my dad blew it off and said that it was probably just a fixable problem with the tire we finally got to the highway and i noticed another problem the car was really sluggish when you pushed the gas at first my sister s car accelerates very quickly so it was a little concerning to think about since my sister has practically the same model of car the reason it was so slow was because the battery wasn t charging i don t know anything about how hybrid cars are supposed to work but i do know that when you put on the break it should charge at least a little bit but the green bars on the gauge that show when the battery is charging did not light up and the gauge that showed the battery charge only had one little bar i kept driving while my dad in the passenger seat fumbled around with the different features the biggest difference between my car and my sister s car is that mine has a little touch screen navigation thing in the console my dad really liked it and was trying to figure out how to use it when the screen turned off he chocked it up to loose wiring and i could tell he was a little disappointed a few minutes later the lights on the air conditioning buttons just below the navigation screen shut off too that s when the real issues started arising while going around a slight curve i felt that the steering wheel was really difficult to turn i decided not to worry about it though because i still had a long way to go before i had to turn i came to a stop at a red light on the highway there are several stores along the road i pulled up a little bit as the person in front of me started to move but when i looked down at the dash the whole display was flickering my dad told me to pull off at a gas station and i did even though i struggled to turn the steering wheel i switched places with him and he drove to an auto parts store just down the road the car was lurching the display was flickering and it wouldn t go over  mph he was able to buy a new battery and replace it quickly it was about   at this point and i was convinced that we wouldn t make it in time my dad drove the rest of the way thankfully as my legs were shaking really bad from the adrenaline and miraculously we made it on time i m so glad that we left early or else we would have been really late as for the car it still has lots of problems there might be a problem with the axle and i think my dad said something about the alternator being the reason the battery wasn t charging sorry if this is written badly i just thought it was funny how many things went wrong yet i still made it on time tl dr i drove the car that my dad recently repaired to rehearsal the battery died on the way but i still got there on time somehow, by driving my new to me car background i  have been learning to drive i have my learners permit so my caring yet cheap dad

682,i'm  f and if i do not get a diagnosis for the neurological condition which has literally destroyed my life symptoms listed in my post in the next year i am considering ending my life euthanasia clinic i'm posting all my symptoms here just in case i can get closure and feel better mri images september    host/i/klttol my symptoms as of  orthostatic tinnitus that is about  different noises playing at once only from the right ear from my knowledge but audiometry was ''perfect'' they can't find anything wrong with my ears as for the noises first one is a noise like the tv stand by tone/colour bars second is a hissing third is a sine wave type noise like a dolphin noise and the fourth one is a screeching noise similar to the hissing noise but louder and more constant these noises play on top of each other making it impossible for me to drown out these noises intermittent orthostatic headache pressure/pain at back of head back pain myoclonus seizure like fast muscle twitch episodes my muscles visibly jerk up and down left and right etc these feel like bugs under my skin and i recorded this happening in my calf not sure how to post video links in a post but if anyone's curious i'll message them the video double vision sensitivity to light and sound gait problems balance problems feeling irritable  sucking feeling at the back of my head like someone's pulling my brain downwards tingling in my spine and scalp sudden ice pick headaches at the back of my head they feel throbbing like and are a  on the pain scale they make me cry or scream when they happen looking really pale all the time to the point everyone points it out to me asking if i'm sick dizziness if i do get vertigo it's rare but when i do get it i am  bedbound for  days throwing up dry heaving unexplained build ups of fluid in my right ear along with the eardrum bulging outwards or being sucked inwards nose that is often stuffy or very runny red spots in the whites of my eyes memory and cognition decline problems getting words out / speech constant sweating even if it's literally freezing syringeomyelia a large fluid filled cyst in my spine and they don't know what is causing that it was noted since i was  years old my recent scan in may last year was interpreted as having no syrinx but there were implications it still could of been there rapid heart beat and intolerance to even mild cold or heat my gp thinks i have ehlers danlos syndrome my neurological symptoms began in  after a go kart accident mild whiplash all of these symptoms are orthostatic which means if i sleep all day / lie down flat my symptoms improve but then when i get up they slowly come back getting progressively worse the longer i am upright sleep seems to be more effective than simply lying down flat so come night time when i want to sleep or relax my symptoms are too debilitating to even have a rest i've been desperately searching for any answers because i am on disability and have a slew of mental health issues because of this condition i sleep every three or four days because it keeps me up at night and literally stops me from relaxing it's torture and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy as this has went on my symptoms got more unpredictable and chronic meaning i don't wake up in bed to complete silence and no twitching anymore i know this nonsense isn't normal because i still remember having none of these symptoms at one point i fucking miss those times i have felt suicidal before i'm on a ton of medications just to stop me harming myself because i'm being tortured by my own brain at this rate i'm scared i'll only get a diagnosis at an autopsy report i've been trying to contact the neurologist who ordered the scan in the images above they were done in september still no word about what is going on i feel i've been ghosted by the nhs and feel very hopeless just in case people tell me to call a doctor i've been doing it every week and i get no

865,i feel so lonely a love scene on netflix made me cry title says it all actually i'm afraid this will be a lengthy post since the first covid lockdown in march  i have been at home i  next week still live with my parents and sibling who also happen to be at home  now my mom is a nurse so naturally we all try to follow the government rules as we don't want to indirectly infect my mother's patients as a consequence and maybe even due to the constant media attention to the measurements we even keep our distance to each other as a family we're no longer hugging or showing any other forms of affection also since the first lockdown i have barely worked outside of our house theaters have closed and i have worked approximately  shifts in the past  months i have zero contact with any of my coworkers life just goes on i guess and when you're in your early  but detest going out you're not really part of the group i must admit i do not have many friends i haven't been very lucky i had three of my so called best friends completely cut me off without prior notice sometimes it makes me wonder what i did wrong or if i even deserve to have friends but that's a whole different story i have two groups of friends  people in total though this is not very important information i have physically seen some of my friends twice since march and on one of those days a family member died so i was a mess since the lockdown we do have weekly skype calls and that's as close as we get most of the time i have to initiate conversation or else i could go on for days without communication it makes me feel so useless but it's sadly one of the effects of social media people just think a lot about themselves also a factor in this whole backstory is the end of my first relationship which was a little over   years ago since we broke up i haven't been dating seeing anyone or slept with anyone the only thing that occurred recently was an attempt at a facebook messenger sext with a guy who i've know for years but who has a gf now basically the best i could do was become the digital but unofficial side piece let me be clear i'm not on board with that all in all this means i haven't really been touched in any way in ages imagine my surprise when i was watching bridgerton and a steamy scene occurred it wasn't overly graphic but for some reason i could feel the guy's hands felt the echo of his lips on mine this just let loose an incredible yearning for not only intimacy but the basic human needs of affection and communication so here i am almost  in the morning alone and crying behind my laptop because two actors on netflix pretended to get laid for the first tim,i feel so lonely a love scene on netflix made me cry title says it all actually i'm afraid this will be a lengthy

going to the gay bar and usually ended up hanging out with my friend and it got to the point that were beginning to be know as a couple and i sort of liked it we danced a lot did the poppers thing while dancing and grew closer and the sexual atmosphere was really hot but i was nervous naive and just scared of what it all meant for me if i was gay he was really patient with me and i knew he wanted me in every way possible and i wanted him too but scared one night we ended up in his place after the bar and took something to relax i lost all inhibitions that night and had the best sex of my life he fucked me and i came without even touching myself i fucked him and swallowed his load we sucked each other off and collapsed hours late in sweaty pile in a spoon position with him holding my cock as we cuddled i really think that i loved him but couldn t deal with the fact that i might be gay what it would mean and pulled back from him i still went to the bar ended up in bed with

502, and forgot to turn off my camera so before i start the story a really short backstory in september i started  grade in our country's school system whenever we students start  grade we have to join a new school with other classmates in my new class there are  students this includes me and only  of these are boys i'm a boy too so let's get into the story school has been fully online since september and we haven't met each other yet because of this we often do conversations on zoom there are about   people in these conversations although when we first started doing them most of the class took part i join most of these conversations and every time i've joined i was the only boy in there all the other   people were girls and usually the same people on avarage we have  or  of these conversations per week so i know a lot about these girls one of them is pretty weird not like anyone in the world is normal cause i'm also the biggest weirdo in the universe but she is outstandingly weird let's call this girl emma so in a conversation about  months ago she said the following ignoring that i was there too don't ask me what we were talking about i don't remember i actually like to wear short clothes and to act in a way which makes guys horny i know that i have a stunning body and i take advantage of that cause i know that guys would do anything for me if they like my body i know this is a weird thing to say and people will start to not believe me here but she did say that before i continue i just want to say that i'm not the type of guy who would do anything for a sexy girl cause i will not fall in love with a girl just because they have a great body but i gotta admit i do become horny most of the times when i see emma she usually wears clothes that only cover the lower half of her breasts and she does generally act in a sexy way on purpose for example she often pretends that she has to pull up her shirt constantly because it's sliding down when in reality she makes it obvious that she is pulling her shirt down just a tiny bit constantly so that she has to pull it up constantly so that she can make a big deal out of it anyways so yesterday emma  other girls and me were in a zoom call we all turned our cameras on and emma was sitting in front of the camera with wet hair and a very tiny bra she said that she just had a bath and she was just drying her hair but she thought she'll join the call anyways and dry her hair during the call one of the other girls asked her why she didn't at least put on actual clothes and she said gosh i'll put some on after drying my hair i though you'd like if i joined the conversation in time so i did in my opinion this is kinda a weird excuse and she was just trying to show cause these conversations usually go on for   hours but i'm probably wrong although this isn't really normal from a girl in my opinion or even from just a person who would join a call with one or more people from the other gender when they are without actual clothes and have wet hair anyways so i was currently wearing pretty tight jeans and underpants i don't have many clothes and when i woke up only these were dried lol and i was getting hard so i knew it would become uncomfortable on the southern parts after a short while since i woke up some of my sweatpants got dried and i knew it would be more comfortable in those so i made up the following ridiculous excuse i gotta go for a few minutes i'll be right back i turned off my camera and mic stood up i pulled down my jeans and underpants as i said those were pretty tiny too and i got some other underpants and some sweatpants after i finished dressing up i sat back next to my computer i clicked on the camera button and instead of my camera screen or whatever zoom was showing my name i knew what this meant my camera didn't turn off and all the girls saw everything i was extremely embarassed i left the call and i only joined back after a few minutes then i just stared at the screen all  girls were laughing but i was crying inside after a minute or so the girls finally stopped laughing and emma said so which one of us made you horny and then they continued laughing at that moment i felt like i had two choices i could either run away and leave the call or be brave stay there and make fun of the situation i decided that the second one would be a better choice it would show that i don't make a big deal out of this and thus the other girls would also not do so also the other thing i thought was that running away and not facing the consequences of a mistake is not a great choice doesn't matter what the mistake is so i stayed there and replied to emma you then i started laughing on purpose they also continued to laugh then after we all stopped laughing and emma dried her hair and put on some actual clothes off camera we had an absolutely normal conversation and nobody brought it up that day anymore i dunno why i wrote down this story but i felt so embarassed at that moment and i still can't frickin believe this happened i just had to write it down hopefully they won't bring this story up in the future but if they do i'm gonna share that one last thing sorry for my bad english and any miswritten words that might be cause of english or cause of autocorrect tl dr i changed clothes but forgot to turn off my camera while in a zoom call with  other girls tgey saw my cock while i was hard when i realized it instead of leaving the call i faced the consequences and laughed at myself, and forgot to turn off my camera so before i start the story a really

1320,i get very l stressed whenever i hear popping sounds outside or anything even close to yelling i cover it up the level of stress i feel from it doesn't make sense i've had two situations in my life that think are the source of my anxiety  years ago i saw the aftermath of a shooting literally right in front of my house i was doing service work with my church and living in louisiana at the time while resting in our apartment we hear some yelling and bang bang bang bang bang really fast it sounded like at least  or  shots i went outside to see what it was assumed it was fire crackers and there was some young boy on the ground dying just  feet away as i started to walk up cops started to show up almost right away turns out it was drug related and something had gone wrong and the cops didn't intervene in time or something it wasn't clear but the scene was really hard for me to process party because the boy was just so young  me and my now wife were hanging out in my apartment and it was getting late i was going to take here home when we hear some loud discussion outside i was living on the third floor of a three story apartment complex at the time and had a clear view of the parking lot in the parking lot there were   cars all pulled in clearly not people who lived there and all of them were out of the cars talking and or yelling one of them was taller and lanky and walking back and forth somewhat manic in his motions he would bend over and yell something and the go back to pacing back and forth a second man started yelling at him and i heard the phrase i should have shot you when muffled that's when we realized we should probably call the cops it's also when we started hearing shots again probably   shots we think just in the air me and my wife dove to the ground when the shots were done i heard two of them run towards our house and yell that they needed to hide i grabbed my own gun and just waited with my wife in case they some how decided to run up all three flights of stairs to hide in my house makes no sense looking back cops came they inspected the area and we gave our reports and that was it beyond those two stories i have seen two other people die in semi violent way when i was really young maybe  or so a man jumped out of the high rise where i grew up went splat all over the sidewalk it was my first exposure to death also when i was in college i saw a boy drown in a river near before the  of july festivities that one sucked because it wasn't clear of he really needed help or not if i had realized might have been able to help him all of a sudden his head went under and never came back up authorities found his body the next day after the festivities anyway that's it i think i just have a strong sense of how easy it is to die and twice i've had yelling escalate to gunfire outside my home others have way worse backgrounds it's not that unique of a story but it's stressful and it's embarrassing when i hear some kids just goofing around and i start going into full fight it flight mod,i get very l stressed whenever i hear popping sounds outside or anything even close to yelling i cover it up the level of stress i feel

835,i grew up in a hoarding house my dad is a hoarder he grew up in poverty and as a result is obsessed with the value of things and keeping everything he gets his hands on as a result my childhood home was absolutely filthy trash everywhere and random junk my mom tried to keep up with it but my dad was so bad that it just wasn't possible and the best she could do was prevent the house from becoming unliveable she was only semi successful even then once i moved out of the house i rarely ever went back because of the filth the room my mom didn't even attempt to keep in check was the garage and by the time i moved out at  you couldn't even open the door all the way there were also  other rooms in the house that were not used as they were filled with mold and trash because this is what i saw growing up i had similar tendencies as a kid i never knew any better and i also had incredibly messy tendencies my room was gross and i was incredibly depressed but moving out and into a home with others for college where i knew i was also responsible for the state of the house started me on a better path i've now been out of the house  and a half years and i have much more normal habits now still a little messy but my life is never even remotely out of control my parents split in  after my mom realized my dad who has a lot of other issues was too much after  years of marriage i dont blame her he didn't treat her well and she deserves better but they sold my childhood home and we had to clean it out my dad didn't want to help or do anything and i wound up spending months traveling home every single weekend to help even though i didnt even have a place to sleep my older sister had moved into my old room because hers had become unliveable and the other spare room was filled to the brim with stuff my mom had been sleeping on the couch in the living room for years because my dad filled the bedroom with trash she spent years drinking herself silly because she hated what her life had become my dad refused to clean out the garage so one day my mom and sister went in and cleared it out as the day was approaching that the house went on the market i was at my apartment when i got a call that shit had hit the fan my dad was having a meltdown that they threw away his stuff he was calling me crying and telling me he was going to kill himself i decided to go back to the house to mediate the situation my sister and mom had left the trash bags on the back porch for my dad to go through before they went on the curb when i went to see them myself i gagged at the smell just getting on the porch i told my mom and sister that while i understood this needed to get done he needed to get rid of these things on his own terms thankfully he was able to go through everything and the situation was resolved when i was growing up i refused to let my friends in my house because my family can be insane and my house was smelly and embarrassing as a result everyone knew something was wrong in my personal life but i kept it to myself and they never pried so i've never told anyone this before most people when they leave their childhood home for the very last time

1313,i was with someone for  years married for  of them they passed away going on  years now and i have to unload how i feel not what you might think i would hope you read this but i will include a tldr at the bottom so yea i'm trying to start my new year flipping myself into a new way of life and thinking and to do that i need to be honest with myself on march   i moved to hawaii to be with women from the first day we were together we argued a lot when we were long distance it was a wonderful time but as soon as we were together things went south hard on top of arguing constantly her family hated me i'm going to spare you  years of torment and heart ache just know our relationship was as toxic as it could possibly be our fights could last up to  days easy physical abuse happened on both sides we lived in shit hole after shit hole before moving back with her parents which i was basically treated slightly worse then the family dog even having to get an outhouse to have a place to use the bathroom i was miserable why did we stay together we both were lonely and had low opinions of ourselves likely she felt what i did this is the best i'll ever do if i leave him/her i'll never find anyone again ohhhh know i had a chance to leave her i met someone online that was everything i had dreamed of she was also a bigger woman which i loved she was very well off bordering on rich she was open funny outgoing traveled a lot and wanted me to be with her why didn't i take it i was afraid it was to good to be true so i bailed out and stuck with what i knew would still be there however that's not the confession fast forward to  and in december my wife was told if she did not change how she was living she would be dead in  months well that scared my now wife to change her ways for about  months before going back to how she was and for  more months she reverted back to living how she wanted and eating how she wanted she was diabetic weighed in excess of  lbs at  smoked and ate pretty much whatever without taking her medication there was more but this is all you need to know the final few days i begged her to see a doctor she had all the signs of kidney failure she wouldn't eat she slept all the time her face was ashen and more finally she did make an appointment though i was begging her to go to the hospital it didn't matter june   days before my birthday i went to sleep at  am narrowly avoiding an argument with her i think she was to tired to fight i woke up  hours later with a sense of dread in my chest i had been waking up and staring at my wife when i do to see if she was still breathing for months now this time when i woke up i noticed she had rolled over onto the floor we slept on a mattress on the floor still bundled in her blanket i shook her several times very hard then i saw it her lips were blue she wasn't breathing anymore form that moment life became a whirlwind that i hardly remember i threw myself into online communities to escape the world i was living in i stayed in hawaii for  year before moving back home to take care of my mother now fast forward  years i've lost  lbs though i've gained back some and am worried i use to live on ssi and snap now i work  jobs own a  ram pick up a motorcycle an rv trailer and more i've come a long way in my life to improve i even have a new fiancé who loves me dearly and is built like no other woman in my eyes at least so what's the confession you ask i don't miss her i grieved for her for awhile but that was more having someone in my life for so long then ending up being alone suddenly now  years out i think of her and well i don't care if someone asked me if i could see her again i would say yes but only because i would want to ask her if she wanted to die because looking back it feels like she did otherwise i see it as  years of my life wasted when i could of been much happier and likely better off had i never met her i feel guilty about it i should care i should miss her honor her but i don't i'm grateful she's gone and i was set free am i wrong for that i don't know but i need to say it in the end my wife passing away and setting me free was the best thing to of ever happened to me in the  years we were together tl dr with someone for  years married for  it was a hell on earth toxic relationship that i could of left but didn't she passed away and i was set free now the only bad feeling i have of the guilt in my chest that i don't miss h,i was with someone for  years married for  of them they passed away going on  years now and i have to unload how i feel not what you might think i would hope you read this but i will include a tldr at the bottom so yea i'm trying to start my new year flipping myself into a new way of life and thinking and to do that i need to be honest with myself on march   i moved to hawaii to be with women from the first day we were together we argued a lot when we were long distance it was a wonderful time but as soon as we were together things went south hard on top of arguing constantly her family hated me i'm going to spare you  years of torment and heart ache just know our relationship was as toxic as it could possibly be our fights could last up to  days easy physical abuse happened on both sides we lived in shit hole after shit hole before moving back with her parents which i was basically treated slightly worse then the family dog even having to get an outhouse to have a place to use the bathroom i was miserable why did we stay together we both were lonely and had low opinions of ourselves likely she felt what i did this is the best i'll ever do if i leave him/her i'll never find anyone again ohhhh know i had a chance to leave her i met someone online that was everything i had dreamed of she was also a bigger woman which i loved she was very well off bordering on rich she was open funny outgoing traveled a lot and wanted me to be with her why didn't i take it i was afraid it was to good to be true so i bailed out and stuck with what i knew would still be there however that's not the confession fast forward to  and in december my wife was told if she did not change how she was living she would be dead in  months well that scared my now wife to change her ways for about  months before going back to how she was and for  more months she reverted back to living how she wanted and eating how she wanted she was diabetic weighed in excess of  lbs at  smoked and ate pretty much whatever without taking her medication there was more but this is all you need to know the final few days i begged her to see a doctor she had all the signs of kidney failure she wouldn't eat she slept all the time her face was ashen and more finally she did make an appointment though i was begging her to go to the hospital it didn't matter june   days before my birthday i went to sleep at  am narrowly avoiding an argument with her i think she was to tired to fight i woke up  hours later with a sense of dread in my chest i had been waking up and staring at my wife when i do to see if she was still breathing for months now this time when i woke up i noticed she had rolled over onto the floor we slept on a mattress on the floor still bundled in her blanket i shook her several times very hard then i saw it her lips were blue she wasn't breathing anymore form that moment life became a whirlwind that i hardly remember i threw myself into online communities to escape the world i was living in i stayed in hawaii for  year before moving back home to take care of my mother now fast forward  years i've lost  lbs though i've gained back some and am worried i use to live on ssi and snap now i work  jobs own a  ram pick up a motorcycle an rv trailer and more i've come a long way in my life to improve i even have a new fiancé who loves me dearly and is built like no other woman in my eyes at least so what's the confession you ask i don't miss her i grieved for her for awhile but

333, open relationship trouble  open relationship having some troubles me and my boyfriend have been together for a year now and we love each other but recently there has been a lot of tension and we have started to fight a lot it all started when we had a fight about me texting one of my exes who is one of my good friends that he knows about happy birthday he kept saying that i shouldn't be in contact with any of my exes and that he felt betrayed this was very weird because he knew about my ex and knew that we were still pretty close during that time there was a lot of tension but he ended up just hate fucking me and forgetting about it we also had a fight about me going to a work event and talking to other guys even though they were my co workers and it was a work conference he claimed that i was being flirty and trying to fuck other guys this was completely untrue and i have done nothing to lead him to think that i would ever do something like that we talked and he said that he was overreacting which i agreed with after that the tension still wasn't resolved and we had many other fights we both noticed that and took some time to talk with each other and are relationship and sex life improved greatly we also opened up about our fantasies and he said he wanted to have a threesome at first i was hesitant but later agreed to it we found this guy who was  muscular and just overall very handsome the original plan was to have a threesome with him but then my boyfriend said that he wanted us to mess around first so we could get to know each other we both discussed some rules and then he let me go with the other guy the other guy was so much different than my boyfriend he was dominant and put me in my place i liked this a lot me and the other guy had so much fun and we tried lots of different stuff like bondage punishments anal etc we also talked about a lot of deep stuff and i started to fall for this guy i told my boyfriend about the feelings i had for the other guy and that we probably shouldn't have a threesome i also told him we should probably cut all times with him he said that it was fine and that it would be hotter because of the taboo aspect and that it would be like unrequited love i told him this was a bad idea but he still wanted me to do it so we get to the day of the threesome and my boyfriend cums fast but still lets me and the other guy finish you could tell when me and the other guy fucked there was a lot more passion later that night my boyfriend liked that another guy could have me and fuck all my holes but he said the threesome arrangement wasn't going to work and he would much rather have an open relationship where both of us would get to fuck other people by ourselves he would go with multiple people but i only wanted the threesome guy this arrangement worked for a couple months but now my boyfriend says he wants me to cut all ties with the other guy because he feels that he can t compare to him and that it will affect our sex life i told him that it wasn't true and that i'm perfectly happy with our sex life but he doesn't believe me he said we could fuck one more time but thats it so the other guy came to my house and we started fooling around but during it my boyfriend walked in and saw us he was livid and said that we should be more careful and what we were doing was disgusting and we should be

verbally abusive it also reminded me of when we used to fight a lot when things cooled down he said i was going to have to choose between him and the other guy tl dr what me and the other guy did was completely consensual and he agreed on it why is he mad what can i do to fix this who should i choos, open relationship trouble  open relationship having some troubles me and my boyfriend have been together for a year now and we love each other but recently there has been a lot of tension and we have started to fight a lot it all started when we had a fight about me texting one of my exes who is one of my good friends that he knows about happy birthday he kept saying that i shouldn't be in contact with any of my exes and that he felt betrayed this was very weird because he knew about my ex and knew that we were still pretty close during that time there was a lot of tension but he ended up just hate fucking me and forgetting about it we also had a fight about me going to a work event and talking to other guys even though they were my co workers and it was a work conference he claimed that i was being flirty and trying to fuck other guys this was completely untrue and i have done nothing to lead him to think that i would ever do something like that we talked and he said that he was overreacting which i agreed with after that the tension still wasn't resolved and we had many other fights we both noticed that and took some time to talk with each other and are relationship and sex life improved greatly we also opened up about our fantasies and he said he wanted to have a threesome at first i was hesitant but later agreed to it we found this guy who was  muscular and just overall very handsome the original plan was to have a threesome with him but then my boyfriend said that he wanted us to mess around first so we could get to know each other we both discussed some rules and then he let me go with the other guy the other guy was so much different than my boyfriend he was dominant and put me in my place i liked this a lot me and the other guy had so much fun and we tried lots of different stuff like bondage punishments anal etc we also talked about a lot of deep stuff and i started to fall for this guy i told my boyfriend about the feelings i had for the other guy and that we probably shouldn't have a threesome i also told him we should probably cut all times with him he said that it was fine and that it would be hotter because of the taboo aspect and that it would be like unrequited love i told him this was a bad idea but he still wanted me to do it so we get to the day of the threesome and my boyfriend cums fast but still lets me and the other guy finish you could tell when me and the other guy fucked there was a lot more passion later that night my boyfriend liked that another guy could have me and fuck all my holes but he said the threesome arrangement wasn't going to work and he would much rather have an open relationship where both of us would get to fuck other people by ourselves he would go with multiple people but i only wanted the threesome guy this arrangement worked for a couple months but now my boyfriend says he wants me to cut all ties with the other guy because he feels that he can t compare to him and that it will affect our sex life i told him that it wasn't true and that i'm perfectly happy with our sex life but he doesn't believe me he said we could fuck one more time but thats it so the other guy came to my house and we started fooling around but during it my boyfriend walked in and saw us he was livid and said that we should be more careful and what we were doing was disgusting and we should be ashamed he also was smashing and throwing things we got into a big fight and he called me a worth nothing dirty whore who will take anyones dick this hurt a lot because of a past relationship that was verbally abusive it also reminded me of when we used to fight a lot when things cooled down he said i was going to have to choose between him and the other guy tl dr what me and the other guy did was completely consensual and he agreed on it why is he mad what can i do to fix this who should i

41, by making old fashioned pop corn a while back i decided to have some popcorn while watching the mentalist the only kind i had was the loose kernel kind you have to pop in a pan in a little bit of oil i have never done this before but thought it'd be fun and i could make a unique flavor with bacon grease butter smoked salt etc when the oil was ready it said to put a single layer of kernels in the bottom of the pan i did that and  seconds later everything was on fire the kernals popped so fast that they overflowed out the pan and went all over the stovetop even when i took the pan off the heat they kept popping and flying out and quite a few landed on the burner immediately bursting into flame so now i'm juggling this still popping overflowing pan while frantically trying to blow out the little popcorn fires when i accidentally blow one onto the counter and up against a roll of paper towels which you guessed it also started burning oh and i was shirtless getting peppered with hot drops of grease and oil the whole time i went from can't wait for some popcorn to everything's on fire in the span of about   seconds i finally set the pan on the floor still popping a bit and a grabbed some tongs to pick up the half enflamed roll of paper towels and tossed it into the sink dousing it with the sprayer the popcorn that was on the burner had mostly burned out their little fires were short lived but intense i blew out the remaining embers caught my breath and looked at the smokey remains of my life kitchen i saved about a third of the popcorn what had stayed in the pan the rest i swept up and tossed then i cleaned up the stove got a well deserved beer from the fridge and sat down with my snack to resume my show but it honestly didn't even taste that good i mean i still ate it all but that was mostly out of spite tl dr tried to make old fashioned popping corn things quickly got out of hand and i set stuff on fir, by making old fashioned pop corn a while back i decided to have some popcorn while watching the mentalist the only kind i had was the loose kernel kind you have to pop in a pan in a little bit of oil i have never done this before but thought it'd be fun and i could make a unique flavor with bacon grease butter smoked salt etc when the oil was ready it said to put a single layer of kernels in the bottom of the pan i did that and  seconds later everything was on fire the kernals popped so fast that they overflowed out the pan and went all over the stovetop even when i took the pan off the heat they kept popping and flying out and quite a few landed on the burner immediately bursting into flame so now i'm juggling this still popping overflowing pan while frantically trying to blow out the little popcorn fires when i accidentally blow one onto the counter and up against a roll of paper towels which you guessed it also started burning oh and i was shirtless getting peppered with hot drops of grease and oil the whole time i went from can't wait for some popcorn to everything's on fire in the span of about   seconds i finally set the pan on the floor still popping a bit and a grabbed some tongs to pick up the half enflamed roll of paper towels and tossed it into the sink dousing it with the sprayer the popcorn that was on the burner had mostly burned out their little fires were short lived but intense i blew out the remaining embers caught my breath and looked at the smokey remains of my life kitchen i saved about a third of the popcorn what had stayed in the pan the rest i swept up and tossed then i cleaned up the stove got a well deserved beer from the fridge and sat down with my snack to resume my show but it honestly didn't even taste that good i mean i still ate it all but that was mostly out of spite tl dr tried to make old fashioned popping corn things quickly got out of hand and i set stuff on fire

445, by almost burning my house down the original fuckup was not today but it took a while to come to a head so hold onto your hats on the upside this is not sex related i bought a house earlier this year which i am very proud of along with that has come lessons in homeownership like the one i just learned i'd been out of town for the weekend and paid my brother to watch my dogs for me he brought them back around  pm we chatted for a few minutes and he departed i went back to my room to watch the latest episode of mandolorian around   or so the power in the bedroom suddenly went out it's an older house and a lot of the downstairs is on the same circuit so i figured i'd just overloaded it somehow which has happened several times i went to check the breaker box and turn the power back on the following is what happened to the best recollection of my stressed memory i tried to flip the breaker but the lights didn't turn back on the breaker also didn't want to stay on i heard what sounded like a weird popping noise though and wondered if an animal has gotten into the wiring and chewed through something/electrocuted itself i went in the direction of the sound and started to smell a little smoke thought this confirmed the animal theory i then walked into the next room and it was full of smoke i turned around to run back and turn all the breakers off when i saw a light coming from under the door of my utility closet full of dread i checked the doorknob for heat then opened the door my utility closet was on fire i flew back around the corner turned off every single breaker and began running around looking for a bucket while calling  us emergency number i remembered i had a bucket sitting right outside the front door from where i'd dispatched and disposed of a snake recently so i grabbed it filled it full of water and threw said water into the closet while holding the phone to my ear with my shoulder and maneuvering around two dogs who had no idea what was going on except that mom was running in circles things smelled weird and this was great fun the  operator informed me that i should not attempt to put it out myself and should instead get myself and my animals out of the house but the first bucket had put about half of it out so i promptly ignored her and threw another bucket onto it because i'll be damned if i was going to let my new pride and joy burn down if i could do something about it while the fire was still relatively small satisfied that it appeared to be out at least on the surface i hauled the animals outside to wait for the fire department fortunately the fire station is not far from my house and they rolled up within a few minutes they confirmed the fire was in fact fully out and not still smoldering somewhere were properly sympathetic then commenced an investigation i was standing outside discussing dogs with one of them when the fire chief came outside and summoned me to come look at something i walked inside and he held up a small gasoline petrol can while doing yardwork over the summer i had been leaving most of the equipment including the gas can sitting in the front room this shares a wall with the utility closet the operative theory of the fire department is that when my brother brought the dogs back one of them knocked over the gas can which still had some gas in it the gas rolled out of the can along the floor under the wall and down into the utility closet which while accessed from the first floor extends into the crawlspace when the water heater next kicked on it ignited the fumes from the gas which traveled to the gas itself then to the wood beams it was on you get the picture thankfully it burned through the wiring early on and while i was still awake i got a shaming lecture from the fire chief about bringing gasoline into the house even to keep it out of the rain and how i needed to just get a small storage shed to put those things in i did not shamefully admit to the fact that i already have a storage shed and just forgot to put the gasoline in it like an idiot because it's on the other side of the yard i then slept on a blanket pallet in the dining room for the next few days because it and the kitchen were the only rooms that still had electricity and also i was paranoid and afraid to be too far away from the utility closet in case it spontaneously combusted for what it's worth the dogs also thought floor camping was great tl dr left gasoline in my house like an idiot someone knocked it over fumes caught fire almost didn't have a house anymor, by almost burning my

1282,i had sex with my cousin and enjoyed it alot made this anonymous acc because there's no way i can post this on my main i'll start off by saying he is my older cousin and we live in a southern state we are the 'rebelious disappointments' of our family and we both love edgy jokes to get a laugh i'm not sure how long ago this started but we'd both casually make jokes about incest between us and our whole insane dysfunctional family for example i jokingly threatened to peg him or he'd say stuff like closer the kin the deeper in or making alabama references as a joke my whole family are alabama football fans but we don't live in alabama cause of the stereotypes well one day we were watching a movie and i sarcastically asked him if he wanted to be little spoon he is a lot bigger and taller than i am so we found it funny and we actually ended up cuddling the entire movie the problem was i could only focus on how fast my heart was beating it really confused me a couple days later i had a wet dream about him and woke up realizing that i actually was attracted to my cousin he is conventionally attractive imo i had in total three dreams about us having sex with eachother that month i kept how i actually felt a secret but would continue to joke with him but as time went on the jokes got more real and flirtatious between us well last night i was spending the night at my grandma's house for new years day and he did as well since my dad and aunt his mom live with her after my gma went to bed my dad aunt and their druggie friends all stayed in the basement while we went upstairs in the living room and watched a movie he complimented my bare body as i changed into pajamas infront of him we sat on the couch together to watch something on netflix since he joked earlier that day that we should netflix and chill we both were also really high his fingers kept teasing me through my underwear and he eventually started fingering me well one thing led to another and we had sex i was amazed by how good he was at it he even picked me up like i weighed nothing and thrusted super deep up into me he was the thickest i've ever had and i was sore after afterwards we got our clothes back on and smoked some more there was no awkwardness between us at all which had me relieved a while later he asked if we should do a round two i was still a bit sore but agreed and we did it again he was really good at eating me out and also put me in a position where he hit my cervix with each thrust there was deep lustful eye contact between us the entire time except when we were in doggie after we finished i was super sore from him rearranging my guts we got our clothes back on and relaxed to catch our breath i made a joke that we are now fwb family with benefits and he laughed everything has been pretty much normal since but there's no going back now i do feel slightly bad because he has a girlfriend and i have a boyfriend,i had sex with my cousin and enjoyed it alot made this anonymous acc because there's no way i can post this on my main i'll start off by saying he is my older cousin and we live in a southern state we are the 'rebelious disappointments' of our family and we both love edgy jokes to get a laugh i'm not sure how long ago this started but we'd both casually make jokes about incest between us and our whole insane dysfunctional family for example i jokingly threatened to peg him or he'd say stuff like closer the kin the deeper in or making alabama references as a joke my whole family are alabama football fans but we don't live in alabama cause of the stereotypes well one day we were watching a movie and i sarcastically asked him if he wanted to be little spoon he is a lot bigger and taller than i am so we found it funny and we actually ended up cuddling the entire movie the problem was i could only focus on how fast my heart was beating it really confused me a couple days later i had a wet dream about him and woke up realizing that i actually was attracted to my cousin he is conventionally attractive imo i had in total three dreams about us having sex with eachother that month i kept how i actually felt a secret but would continue to joke with him but as time went on the jokes got more real and flirtatious between us well last night i was spending the night at my grandma's house for new years day and he did as well since my dad and aunt his mom live with her after my gma went to bed my dad aunt and their druggie friends all stayed in the basement while we went upstairs in the living room and watched a movie he complimented my bare body as i changed into pajamas infront of him we sat on the couch together to watch something on netflix since he joked earlier that day that we should netflix and chill we both were also really high his fingers kept teasing me through my underwear and he eventually started fingering me well one thing led to another and we had sex i was amazed by how good he was at it he even picked me up like i weighed nothing and thrusted super deep up into me he was the thickest i've ever had and i was sore after afterwards we got our clothes back on and smoked some more there was no awkwardness between us at all which had me relieved a while later he asked if we should do a round two i was still a bit sore but agreed and we did it again he was really good at eating me out and also put me in a position where he hit my cervix with each thrust there was deep lustful eye contact between us the entire time except when we were in doggie after we finished i was super sore from him rearranging my guts we got our clothes back on and relaxed to catch our breath i made a joke that we are now fwb family with benefits and he laughed everything has been pretty much normal since but there's no going back now i do feel slightly bad because he has a girlfriend and i have a boyfriend

450, by trying to ring in the new year with some bubbly didn t happen today but the after effects have been ongoing until now being a particularly glum end of a very sad holiday season in  i decided i would get some moderately priced champagne and celebrate it right the clock struck  and i had the bottle ready as my plan was to get drunk and binge netflix all morning until i fell asleep to the sun coming up usually it s not very hard to remove the cork i can typically just yank it off without much effort but this one was a bit stubborn i used an overpriced pampered chef champagne cork remover thing i purchased and maybe only had the opportunity to use twice hoping to get a better grip on the thing the device has scary looking metal teeth on a handle that only succeeded in ripping off the top of the cork so i was left with a broken cork and nothing to drink to bring in the new year i was very determined to keep to my plan so i googled different ways you were supposed to open the bottle now used an icing/hot water trick the shoe thing pushing it down to get it loose but nothing seemed to get the thing to budge it says specifically not to use a corkscrew but i thought what the heck i ll just be sure to keep it pointed well away from my face or anything breakable in my kitchen i managed to get the screw portion in a few turns and pulled with all my strength this only resulted in me pulling off the top of the corkscrew which fell into the sink and broke one of my favorite mugs so now i had an unopened bottle a broken corkscrew a broken mug and an ever growing obsession to get this bottle open and save the rest of my evening another less preferred method because booze and sharp objects do not mix is to use a small flat knife to try and wedge it between the cork and the bottle this only led to pieces of the cork crumbling off and making it even more difficult to pull the thing out so i just go for it and start jamming the knife in there in an attempt to push the cork into the bottle i give myself a good wind up and proceed to jab the knife directly into the knuckle of my thumb and the pain and blood pooling out of my finger is instantaneous and massive i run into the bathroom trying to find some first aid materials and turn my sink into an episode of forensic files while i splash alcohol and wrap the thing with paper towels after the bleeding stops and i ve found something i can use as a bandage i put a scrap of paper towel on the cut with some bacitracin and secured it with an anti snoring nose strip i return to the bottle it s about   now at this point i am angry and wounded and need a win to start my  i do finally succeed in pushing the rest of that fucker in the bottle and enjoy a cork filled flat glass of bubbly before calling it a night at around   later that evening i decide to venture out for some proper first aid supplies and drive about a block or so to cvs i load up on junk food bandaids and gauze and head back home it started to ice but i wasn t worried i only live a few minutes away the road was a bit slippery and i hit a pothole a little too quickly and pop my front tire i had to work the following day saturday so i get up early find a local service station and beg them to put on my donut so i can get to work thankfully my luck is shifting by this point and i get to work with  minutes to spare and arrange to get a new

75, by eating a caesar salad and going for a run obligatory not today i promised my kid i'd wait until he was at least  to tell this story i was working super hard at changing my eating habits and had recently discovered salad i especially loved wendy's salads and i had just eaten a cesar salad for dinner when i decided to go up the street to the middle school track and walk/run a few laps the middle school recently had all the roads rerouted around it and as a result the back doors faced the main road right outside the back doors was a massive blacktop leading up to the track they had  square and hop scotch areas tetherball and a basketball court because of the roads being ripped up and re done the new parking lot also faced the back doors so i was able to drive up and park right in front of/on the basketball court it was dusk and i had just completed my  lap when my stomach started cramping and gurgling i wasn't too concerned because i had already learned that the healthier foods digest differently often causing gas or bubbles in my tummy i had felt that before and it always subsided without incident four laps made a mile so i continued on going for the mile i was halfway through my  lap when things got serious the ripping feeling across my bowels and the incredibly loud sounds coming up from my stomach were both insisting that i get to a toilet fast i wait for the cramping to subside and make a run for it i was the furthest away from my car that i could have been i bolt across the middle grassy area and before i got halfway there i had to stop and sit again just in an effort to keep the poop in there were no toilets around my stomach was raging i wasn't gonna get another window i was gonna have to pinch my cheeks together and waddle run to my car i was feet away from my car when i knew it was either shit my pants or squat where i was i frantically yanked my pants down and as i was trying to squat in front of my car to hide from the main road my stomach exploded i shat on myself my pants around my ankles my own car hood the license plate and the basketball court i was covered in sweat shit and shame i couldn't even understand what just happened i grabbed some garbage from my back seat placed it on the driver seat and drove home i took a scalding shower got dressed and went outside to clean the poop off my car hood my son comes out curious why i'm dumping hot water on the license plate so i told him he laughed so hard that i put him up for adoption no takers i realized that i couldn't just leave the poop at the school so i filled jugs with hot water grabbed a scrubber and my recently orphaned child and went to the school to clean up my mess i left my car lights on so i could make sure i got it all and when i pulled up it looked like someone had died there it was an odd almost reddish color and after the  gallons of hot water and bleach it was clear i left a  foot tall  foot wide shit stain on the basketball court my son was horrified mom i go to school here now it was my turn to laugh hysterically which i did as my  year old son looked traumatized i found out the next day that cesar salad dressing has anchovy paste in it which can cause explosive shits in just about anyone don't care i still eat it for the next two years the stain very slowly faded everytime my kid went outside for recess he would see the stain and die of embarassment even though we were the only ones who knew it was super useful anytime my kid got mouthy i'd just threaten to tell his friends about the stain he rejoiced when it was time for him to move onto the high school  years after the whole blacktop was ripped up and replaced along with the school and track i stuck with my diet and lost  pounds the stain is gone and so is

my pants or squat where i was i frantically yanked my pants down and as i was trying to squat in front of my car to hide from the main road my stomach exploded i shat on myself my pants around my ankles my own car hood the license plate and the basketball court i was covered in sweat shit and shame i couldn't even understand what just happened i grabbed some garbage from my back seat placed it on the driver seat and drove home i took a scalding shower got dressed and went outside to clean the poop off my car hood my son comes out curious why i'm dumping hot water on the license plate so i told him he laughed so hard that i put him up for adoption no takers i realized that i couldn't just leave the poop at the school so i filled jugs with hot water grabbed a scrubber and my recently orphaned child and went to the school to clean up my mess i left my car lights on so i could make sure i got it all and when i pulled up it looked like someone had died there it was an odd almost reddish color and after the  gallons of hot water and bleach it was clear i left a  foot tall  foot wide shit stain on the basketball court my son was horrified mom i go to school here now it was my turn to laugh hysterically which i did as my  year old son looked traumatized i found out the next day that cesar salad dressing has anchovy paste in it which can cause explosive shits in just about anyone don't care i still eat it for the next two years the stain very slowly faded everytime my kid went outside for recess he would see the stain and die of embarassment even though we were the only ones who knew it was super useful anytime my kid got mouthy i'd just threaten to tell his friends about the stain he rejoiced when it was time for him to move onto the high school  years after the whole blacktop was ripped up and replaced along with the school and track i stuck with my diet and lost  pounds the stain is gone and so is my fupa but the memory lives on and the mystery probably does too because the stain was noticed by many tl dr salad made me shit on my car myself and all over the basketball court at my son's middle school edit weight loss   com/nnbxujf jpg yes i know my face is stupid i can't stop it from doing that shit whenever a camera is pointed at me
401, by letting me act before i think so the story is this today school has started again and it goes semi normal though one thing is i needed some new headphones for my laptop so i can focus in class as my dog had bit on my previous ones so me and my mom planned to go to target to get some after school though unexpectedly to me at least a good friend of hers had visited us and brought his son i wanted to hang out with him so i thought we would play cod warzone thing is i didn t have gold/live also for context or anything i am  years old i live with my mom and do not work i have a debit card in which i get money either through child support or something similar though today i only had like  in my account yes seriously just know i m a avid collector of transformers and have a lack of self control when it comes to them and the opportunities to buy them this is important for later on anyways back to the story so instead of being honest and say play a single player game i go ahead and buy the  month membership for gold which is  i believe which puts me in the negatives/a overdraft fee already to around  we play the friend and his son soon leave and i tell my mom on the purchase and she says we have to go to the bank to deposit money for that overdraft fee we do so but we first go to target to get the small groceries my mom bought there via take out she said i should take this opportunity to go inside and find some headphones she gives me  and i had  in my wallet already just note that this money was given to me by my aunt to save for a gaming pc she gave  it goes normally most of the headphones seemed to have sold out cause it was late but i find some for around  i believe but then the plastic addiction took over i consider me collecting transformers a plastic addiction i go to the toy isle where the transformers are and see some toys i was really interested in and wanted i was thinking at first but my impulsive took over and i got  figures each   each in which i go to the self checkout the cost was around   to lower it i used the little money i had   in the target mobile app i do it now the price was   i continue the checkout getting  in change i go back to the car and basically keep on thinking on my horrible decision my mom gets upset initially but she s had a long day so she stopped we then went to a atm to get money out of her own account we use different banks and transferred it to my account which i still feel horrible for as she is using her own money to correct my mistake so yeah thanks for reading and hope you all have a good week and year even tl dr got myself into a overdraft fee with me knowing fully went to target and had money that was to be used for only some headphones use it to buy transformers figures mom had to take

242, by being vegan and possibly giving my family botulism i am vegan my husband is not for new year s eve we ordered a giant box of mediterranean food that was mostly vegan with a few non vegan sauces for the husband last night i was looking to use up the last of the nonvegan garlic sauce since it's only a few days old i figured it had to be fine and mixed it into my husband s portion of spaghetti as hubby takes his plate to the tv to eat i hear him in the other room going oh god oh god i think damn he really likes it until he marches back into the kitchen announcing that it was bad off no good it tastes like chemicals he says i take a bite off his plate because that s what people do when something is bad the militant vegans will probably be here soon to tell me that this single action probably took out a big section of the amazon and killed the last forest fairy but anyway i still think it s fine but except for these stolen bites i ve been vegan for a long time so maybe i can t tell anymore we dump his plate throw out the rest of the sauce feed him off of my portion of dinner and resolve to have ice cream later to make it up except something is nagging me after i finish my dinner i go back to the garbage can and pull the sauce out it s kinda bubbly i can jellies and vegetables sometimes and start freaking out oh my god i just ate botulism i call out for husband my vision is greying i am having a panic attack we live in an urban area hospitals are at capacity with covid and i just gave us botulism husband tells me to calm down as i'm taking off my sweater and pants to get maximum airflow on this rolling ball of overheating anxiety attack botulism doesn t taste bad he says i challenge him to show me where an authority says that something that tastes bad can t coexist with botulism i decide while he s doing that i m going to return to the arms of my teenage fling with bulimia after i m done horking up enough mangled spaghetti and bread to convince myself that that cursed stolen spoonful of botulism must have come out too i clean up and rejoin my husband he says show me this sauce so we go to the fridge in which i ve wrapped up the remaining sauce in order for the cdc to test it for botulinum when i am in the hospital with paralyzed vocal cords my husband examines it prods it and suddenly sticks his finger in it to taste it

about to have my soul crushed by parental disappointment i had to really focus to get the story out of my lips and as i finish say my goodbyes and start to walk off stage i have the butterflies of a

1243,i literally hate everyone in my life rn just because i'm a petty asshole sorry this is probably gonna be a long one also sorry mods if this post doesn't follow guidelines long time lurker here idk how this works i literally hate all my friends at the moment for really no good reason i made really good friends with my roommates last year pre covid and due to multiple circumstances i ended up getting housed this year with new terrible roommates that i also very much dislike and have major anxiety being around my past two roommates basically ended up moving in together and due to covid guidelines i can't live with them not their fault but i'm incredibly pissed about it because they already have a better friendship between themselves than with me and one was supposed to live with me this year but flaked they're together rn and i literally cannot stand the thought of going to see them in a covid safe of course i've been the third friend my whole life and i really thought this was the one time where i wasn't i have another friend who lives with my boyfriend and i can't stand him either he likes to pick on me a lot and i'm sensitive af so he makes me cry all the time without knowing it no matter how hard i try to be cool about it or be funny or just chill or whatever i swear that guy always picks on me until i fucking break along with subtle criticisms or complaints about how to conduct ourselves around the apartment that are always directed at me don't wanna get too detailed but i can tell because they are things you would nitpick a girl for and i'm usually the only girl there even though they weren't things i did or had anything to do with even worse my boyfriend's ex texted me about how he basically was trying to cheat on me it wasn't true and i knew she did it just to cause problems in our relationship but it worked not because i believed her but because it revealed a whole bunch of shit i had no clue about i thought he stopped talking to her way earlier than he actually did he wrote a post about her anonymously like  months ago we've been dating longer than that and just a bunch of stuff he always seems to conveniently leave out that i find out much later things that hurt hurts even more because whenever i have something happen to me like a guy texts me out of the blue and i think he likes me or something i always tell him immediately when his ex texted me i told him the second it happened the worst part is i have no one to talk to the only other people i talk to is a guy who is trying to play off the fact that he heard i was single and definitely wanted to hook up with me as just wanting to be my friend and an old friend who's mental health has got significantly better so i don't want to drag them down into this hell pit i'm in i know i pushed everyone away myself and that's my fault but damn i just feel so empty about it all if not empty i just feel sorrow and nothing else tl dr basically everyone i was close to before covid i know hate for some petty reason or another i understand i'm being a piece of shit but no amount of trying has gotten me out of this feeling the worst part is i have no one to talk to and feel like

74, by not taking piles seriously tldr went on a celebratory major city break and somehow got piles a few days prior to leaving ended up leaving a heritage museums bathroom in a bad way so this didn't happen today however i think the dust has settled and enough time gone by that it is safe to post also my partner let's call her lupita still isn't aware of this last year it was a big birthday for myself so lupita treated me to a major trip away to nyc a first for me and her unfortunately for me a few days prior to leaving istarted to experience a bit of pain when going to the toilet and in general sitting down walking etc having never dealt with anything like piles little hemorrhoids/lumps and bumps in and around the butt hole particularly discomforting  would not recommend before i did what any rational male would do ignored it refusing to believe it may be because i'm getting older and hoped i would be somehow cured in time for our trip away by doing absolutely nothing the trip comes around involving a drive of a few hours to get to the airport great rather uneventful just the odd jiggling around to get comfortable then the flight  hours of trying to balance on one cheek to ease the discomfort we get there the first few days are pretty typical of what has now become the norm uncomfortable pain in whatever activity i'm doing however once in a lifetime trip you're gonna just get on with it right one day we head to a heritage museum after a particularly long walk fu pt  literally  minutes in to a  hour museum trip thankfully unguided i get a weird sort of medicinal smell and feel like i've got a super sweaty butt after a couple of comments from lupita about it smelling like sweaty feet i hope my feet don't smell like that i proceed to walk behind her while trying to give everyone else in there luckily it was quiet a gap of about  meters after pretty much the full tour made my excuses and headed to the bathroom just as i thought one/multiple of the piles had burst there was so much blood as in i'm not sure how i didn't feel faint kind of amount i proceeded to try and get rid of as much as possible in one of those odd the bottom of the door is pretty much in line with my manhood american bathrooms at the thought of being seen with my trousers down while wiping at a severely bloody butt i speed wiped to clear up as much of the monstrosity as possible in my haste forgetting to flush as i went fu pt  this did not sit well with the toilet as i flushed and the ever rising tide looked like it was going to rush over the top of the bowl like the ever growing tide of shame was washing over me thankfully it stopped and just sat there settling enough to look deep in to my eyes through the reflection and question who i a really am as a person my action may not be deemed as valiant or brave more cowardly trousers up wash hands run away i am hoping that if someone is watching over me i am not solely judged on my actions that day a word of warning if this happens to you get yourself checked out ignorance is not bliss it is painful and smells kinda weird, by not taking piles seriously tldr went on a celebratory major city break and

232, by implying to my music teacher that i had emotional trauma related to the song take on me okay so the title pretty much says it all but hopefully after reading it you re left with questions anyways here s my story i was in my sophomore year of high school when this happened luckily the teacher this happened to was a substitute so there wasn t any lasting embarrassment that doesn t mean this won t keep me up at night i m neurodivergent severe adhd and i tend to hyperfixate on my own music taste going on and on about that one part in that one song that makes sad brain produce happy chemical unfortunately the opposite is true for songs i don t like as i tend to complain about them to whoever s unfortunate enough to listen i ve never liked the song take on me it just kinda felt repetitive and annoying of course this wouldn t be as big of a problem if i didn t have two younger siblings now i love my siblings with all my heart but they really do have a way of pissing me off after hearing one of my tangents about how take on me was annoying and overplayed they conveniently decided that was their new favorite song of all time and they would sing it over and over again before family dinners during the chores we were forced to do together all the damn time eventually i got tired of it and told them to stop big mistake they would purposefully sing it loudly whenever i d had a long day was in a bad mood or was annoyed about anything over time take on me devolved from kinda annoying to if i have to hear this goddamn song one more time i m gonna rip off my ears boil them in holy water and toss them off a cliff fast forward to sophomore year i m in a school choir with about   other people we had just gotten back from winter break and if i wasn t so filled with teenage angst i would probably be excited to see what new song we d be learning and performing when my substitute teacher played the track for our new song a chill tan down my spine it was fucking take on me by a ha acapella edition i felt betrayed i had finally managed to escape this song that lived in the back of my brain like a storm cloud on the horizon of an otherwise mild sea this song with an unmistakable hook that had snared me like a clueless fish looking for a snack this fucking song which deceived me with the notion that it was going away for good only to break into my home in the dead of night and slay me in my sleep of course i started looking for a way to get myself out of having to sing it i asked my choir substitute if i could get an exemption for personal reasons she offered to give me extra help on the parts i found hard and i replied that i had an issue with the song itself and that i have a bad memory attached to it she apologized profusely and allowed me a pass i left the class feeling satisfied the next day i was doing homework when my parents came into my room we need to talk apparently my music teacher thought i might have some kind of trauma related to take on me and called my parents because she was worried about me mortified i had to explain the whole scenario to my parents who were trying hard to contain their laughter i ended up having to sing it like everyone else i hated it but at least it s over i ve had my fair share of embarrassing moments but most of them like the infamous bus incident were funny in retrospect and i can still laugh about it with my friends this one haunts me so much that it stays only between me myself and the  million strangers on reddit adhd is fun y all tl dr i hate the song take on me i told my choir

betrayed i had finally managed to escape this song that lived in the back of my brain like a storm cloud on the horizon of an otherwise mild sea this song with an unmistakable hook that had snared me like a clueless fish looking for a snack this fucking song which deceived me with the notion that it was going away for good only to break into my home in the dead of night and slay me in my sleep of course i started looking for a way to get myself out of having to sing it i asked my choir substitute if i could get an exemption for personal reasons she offered to give me extra help on the parts i found hard and i replied that i had an issue with the song itself and that i have a bad memory attached to it she apologized profusely and allowed me a pass i left the class feeling satisfied the next day i was doing homework when my parents came into my room we need to talk apparently my music teacher thought i might have some kind of trauma related to take on me and called my parents because she was worried about me mortified i had to explain the whole scenario to my parents who were trying hard to contain their laughter i ended up having to sing it like everyone else i hated it but at least it s over i ve had my fair share of embarrassing moments but most of them like the infamous bus incident were funny in retrospect and i can still laugh about it with my friends this one haunts me so much that it stays only between me myself and the  million strangers on reddit adhd is fun y all tl dr i hate the song take on me i told my choir teacher that i couldn t sing it because of a personal issue and she interpreted it as some sort of emotional trauma and called my parents to ask if i was okay
212, by falling asleep wearing earbuds so our story begins in march of   months ago one fateful night i was posted up in bed listening to music with earbuds the kind with the little rubber pieces that go in your ear this is important my usual plan when i do this is to at some point before i fall asleep remove the earbuds from my ears and fall asleep so as not to damage the earbuds this was not a very realistic plan and almost every night i did this i would fall asleep with the earbuds in usually this did not cause any problems as the earbuds would gradually make their way out of my ears over the course of the night and i would retrieve them from out of my blankets in the morning this march morning was no exception and i woke up without earbuds in my ears while retrieving the ear buds from my blankets i noticed that one of the little rubber bits was missing i didn t think much of it as i lose them all the time and i had plenty of extras so i replaced the rubber bit however at that point i started to notice a shooting pain in my right ear it felt like i had ruptured my ear drum again i ruptured both ear drums on  separate occasions over the course of the previous year so i went to my university s student health center the np there didn t see anything wrong with my ear but she gave me some ear drops which i used a few weeks later it had not gotten any better so i went to urgent care same result doctor didn t see anything gave me ear drops repeat one more time after another couple of weeks at this point i had really stopped caring about it i had gotten used to the pain and the lack of hearing and i didn t think about it until maybe last month last month my hearing in my right ear got noticeably worse overnight it didn t even cross my mind to go see a doctor until

9, by drinking way too much passing out and this happened about  years ago and it s taken every single day since to be able to talk about this one night an ex and i decided to drink together i m not the biggest drinker in the world and don t have an amazing tolerance so what you d expect to happen did in fact happen one second we were laughing the room was spinning everything blurred and then lights out when i opened my eyes i noticed we were in bed together i didn t remember going to bed in fact i didn t remember much at that moment but it was light out the birds were chirping and something felt wet down by my butt area oh no did i pee the bed i thought in a mild panic i lifted the sheets and to my absolute horror i saw that didn t pee but rather i had explosive diarrhea all over myself and her i ve been through a lot of shit in my life pardon the pun car accidents near death experiences brawls police chases and many other adrenaline inducing events and nothing i repeat nothing i have ever gone through put me in such a state of panic as that very moment i still remember the needle sensation all over my body as i began to flash sweat i look over and she s still sound asleep good i have some time to figure this out when you re panicked like that you start to think of some pretty crazy ideas one of which was to blame it on her since the indent of her body caused a mud slide in her direction thereby saturating her panties all i had to do was remove my boxers and throw them out the window then i d gently wake her up and say babe listen don t be alarmed but you pooped all over yourself and me don t be embarrassed this stuff happens and i still love you i d just have to scoop some of my poop into her butt crack to really sell it but what if she woke up in the process i think that would be somehow harder to explain my other plan was to pull the sheets out from under her like some sort of lounge magician i didn t think it would work but i d be a fool if i didn t consider everything time is ticking and every second that goes by makes me panic more we re breaking up she will immediately break up with me i mean i pooped all over her can a relationship really withstand that can she ever respect me again look me in the eye without thinking of someone else s poop all over her butt can i think of her sexy round butt cheeks without them being tainted by images of my diarrhea all over them while these and a thousand other thoughts race through my head she wakes up her eyes slowly open and she gives me a smile and kisses me good morning our last kiss i assume she tells me she had a good night i was so funny how i passed out and she put me in bed she doesn t notice the mess she s laying in i hold those sheets down with all my might after a few minutes of talking she decides to get up to go to the bathroom i tell her to wait i have to tell you something she looks at me concerned like i m going to break up with her or something i guess she could read the seriousness of my face i need you to slide out of bed and go take a shower don t look at the sheets don t look at anything just go in the shower right now she was always the type of girl who would do the exact opposite of what you told her to do she ripped the sheets off me saw me laying in my shame and started laughing hysterically she laughed for what seemed to be  years she s probably still laughing now she told me not to worry she s a nurse and she sees this every day she smiled and shook her head i balled all the sheets and told her i d wash them her condo didn t have machines so i told her i d take them with me i remember carrying a ball of poop sheets naked around her place because i didn t know what to do with them she took them from me and said she d take care of it she was used to cleaning poop at the hospital she never brought it up again and she made me feel real comfortable about it we didn t break up then at least the relationship lasted  more years after that but not before her dog licked my butt hole during sex once but that s another story for another time i wish that was the only time i got drunk and pooped the other time i was with a bunch of my cousins and they told me that i was so drunk that i pulled my pants down and pooped in the corner in front of everyone then i went to sleep they left it there for me to clean up in the morning

4, by sitting too close to the fire to escape hell tl/dr down the bottom note maybe not suitable for arachnophobes so this happened about  years ago in australia just outside of jindabyne nsw we were all around  years old at the time and were looking forward to letting loose a little a group of about ten of us went on a trip to a holiday house in new south wales mountain region it wasn t cold enough to snow but the nights were pretty crisp so we pulled up an old outdoor bbq and proceeded to build a fire as it usually goes the size of the fire continued to grow and we were all nestling into our positions around it for optimal warmth then a couple of the boys came back from a wood hunt with a big branch that was pretty fresh about   meters long and it requires  people to lift it then they placed the heavy end on the fire and we sat down to watch it catch it was a fairly slow process because the fire wasn t really big enough for the branch to catch quickly and there was a bit of smoke due to the big chunk of bark wrapped around the end in the fire once it began to catch i scootched my seat a bit closer and bathed happily in the warmth at this point someone said what the fuck and another shouted its breathing as he pointed at the huge piece of bark which was now literally breathing in and out against the branch we could hear sizzling and we all jumped up then it began one huntsman spider big scary/hairy mofo s which are basically harmless in a giant shaq like way crawled out of gap between the branch and bark and then just fell into the fire to die then another and another and within  seconds it seemed like there were hundreds pouring out trying to escape the heat imagine world war z zombies but spiders they quickly discovered they could avoid the fire by just running down the log and jumping onto the grass or going the whole way into darkness i jumped up on my seat as did a few others while the rest just ran onto the concrete into the safety of the light soon enough the whole ground was alive with spiders running through the grass and into the darkness i was stuck on my seat just looking around at this waiting for it to end but they just kept on pouring out of under the bark and either escaping or sizzling in the fire the log was alive looking at the ground was like a horror acid trip and the only thing protecting me was the old wirey camping chair i was perched on yet it kept on going more spiders the guys on the concrete were laughing because they didn t want to go into the light and of course me and the other guys stuck in the spider sea like me were screaming and laughing hysterically it was the end of the fucking world after probably only  minutes felt like much longer the stream of spiders began to fade and the ones that made it were presumably making a break in the darkness for the trees while their comrades cooked it died down surprisingly quickly because where their nest was was now completely in flames and we all jumped up onto the concrete after ten minutes the log was burning perfectly we were getting chilly and there literally wasn t a spider in sight we shook off our seats checked every nook and cranny nearby and after giving it enough thought we all eased back into our positions and laughed traumatically until the adrenaline rush passed it was so creepy that we literally couldn t find a single one of them in the grass or around us but we figure we just had to do our best to stop thinking about it and continue drinking tldr sat to close to fire and i couldn t escape an exodus of large spiders so had to wait it out while standing on my seat edit whoa thanks for the awards but pease don t use your money on this and shoutout to the arachnophobes who dodged a bullet p s as an aussie i understand the fear of the creepy crawlies but i will take seeing a deadly spider or snake from a meter away any day over seeing a bear or wolf from a mil, by sitting too close to the fire to escape hell tl/dr

124, by committing third degree vehicular fishicide uhh short ish i was visiting my uncle s farm with my sister my mom and her husband i was mostly there to visit their animals they have a mini donkey and this creepily too friendly little goat that tried to follow me into their house because family banter in my neck of the woods is about as pro cheeto as you can get and it s the same old same old they had my  year old cousin programmed to say i love tr mp he s better than lyin biden that creep like one of those old pull the string to talk toys she really believed it though and that says enough she also regaled my sister and i with the tale of mermgleskofen or some weird norse word that she seemed very intent on letting us know it meant little black boy her prize winning angus beef steer we got to see him in all his meaty glory she was so proud of him anyway i crack open a couple twisted teas to cope with the poor decision making that brought me to even attempting to engage in some kind of fulfilling conversation with these guys now these weren t any twisted teas my uncle s wife s friend who i totally think shags both of them on the regular because they were looking at each other real odd and weirdly kinda flirting after getting about six or so beers ahead of me but let s not talk about that brought them in complaining about how freezing she was from the cold from the horseback ride she went on over her huge  acre property so naturally someone tells her to get a better coat ironically now she responds i am one broke racial slur i can t buy no carhartt you you you literally were just talking about riding a horse you own on  acres of your own property owning a horse is expensive but come on anyway this warrants a couple more teas i m balls deep into four cans by now and then here it comes the love of my life the absolute best time i will ever have my little cousin comes scooting in from some corner of the house on this absolute beauty of modern technology a hoverboard with an attachment that turns it into a gokart blasting god s country by eric church thanks to the nifty bluetooth speakers with matching lights like a sweet and cherubic future goblin angel she drifts a corner around the table and into the living room and asks wanna drive it so of course i m like oh you betcha and to my inebriated bliss i am whipping absolute shitties in the living room on this blessing of modern ingenuity having a blast i felt like a real formula one racer tokyo drift mode i will spend my life chasing this high and then it happened i was very swiftly reminded why dui s exist one wrong movement and i send the cart and my ass at mach  into the living room table causing what one might call a small seismic event inside my cousin s  gallon fish tank nothing was too terribly disturbed but all i m going to say is twenty minutes later after i decided drunk hoverkarting may not have been the brightest plan my cousin was staring very intently at the fish tank asking dad why is he sleeping on the pebbles uncle very curtly inspects the tank and says oh that fucker is dead meanwhile i m sitting in a corner smiling and minding my own business uhhh yeah haha i

139, by doing shrooms with a gay furry i m on mobile so i apologize for any formatting errors on my part in advance some backstory so this happened a few weeks ago couple of days before christmas actually i m on leave paid vacation in the military so i text my friend and ask him what he s up to i will refer to this friend as b henceforth i ve known b for a few years i met the dude on omegle several summers ago and we really hit it off from there him and i exchanged discord usernames after a few hours of chatting and quickly developed a friendship online despite never meeting each other in the flesh and the fact that we had two completely different personalities we would always play cod together fuck around with people on omegle or just talk i should mention that b is also a furry b tells me that he s free so we talk about me coming down to visit him and his boyfriend let s just call b s boyfriend tony from here for a few days and he thinks that it d be a great idea so i book my flight the next day i fly down to tampa and b picks me up we shoot the shit for a bit talking about how nice it is to finally hang out until we arrive at his place the next few nights are really just partying and getting drunk and b and tony showing me around tampa amongst other shit now the fuck up before i know it it s my last night with them so b decides to bust out the magic mushrooms after some discussion i tell him i ve never tried any psychedelics before he says i ll be fine fuck it after a bit of research along with some preparation i decide that i m finally ready i was a bit anxious and didn t really know what to expect but i trusted b nonetheless he gives me   grams of what he describes to me as a gentler strain mixed in with a smoothie to start me off i inhale the thing about  minutes pass i soon notice that my field of vision expands b i see everything i keep on saying i then start talking out of my ass like i m fucking socrates or some shit regardless i handle the first batch well aside from an enhanced cone of vision and the philosophizing i don t notice any other effects b notices how well i m taking the high so he whips up another smoothie after i agree to it this time with a stronger strain of shrooms also   grams i down it within  minutes once again i feel nothing at first but then after about another  to  minutes that s when things start to go wrong i m suddenly laughing my ass off at some shitty inside joke between the two of us repeating it over and over again being loud as fuck the next i m sweating literal gallons of perspiration and my heart is fucking racing then for some reason my body forgets how to breathe so i have to think about inhaling then exhaling breathing manually is the best way that i can describe it then b plays some wild music and i close my eyes and all i see is naked dudes teabagging me it was fucking weird b then hands me some water and for some reason this is what set off my extreme paranoia i immediately get up from his couch where i was sitting grab my phone and wallet from a nearby table and start putting my shoes on telling him that i was gonna go for a walk he tells me that it wasn t a good idea after some thought i reluctantly agree deciding that it wasn t the best idea to go outside when you re high as fuck off of shrooms but i m still just as paranoid so i go outside to a screened in porch like area through an adjoining sliding glass door in his apartment and just sit out there with his dog he brings tony into the living room with him now extremely concerned i chill for a bit outside and then come back inside and then tell him that i think he tried to drug me with the water and pull a bill cosby on me i argue with b and tony for a bit still not convinced that i can trust either one of them i then lock myself in their bathroom for about  minutes while i piece together the events that have unfolded in the past hour i sort out my thoughts try to make sense of everything and eventually come to the conclusion that i wasn t drugged and b wasn t tryna toss my salad i had known him for years if he wanted to drug and then rape someone he would have done it long before i hung out with him b is obviously hurt so i apologize to him and tony for being a cockhead and they both go to bed while i crash on the couch now with a killer stomach ache tl dr did shrooms with a friend and thought he pulled a a bill cosby on me turns out i was just being hella paranoid, by doing shrooms with a gay furry i m on mobile so i apologize for any formatting errors on my part in advance some backstory so

the next i m sweating literal gallons of perspiration and my heart is fucking racing then for some reason my body forgets how to breathe so i have to think about inhaling then exhaling breathing manually is the best way that i can describe it then b plays some wild music and i close my eyes and all i see is naked dudes teabagging me it was fucking weird b then hands me some water and for some reason this is what set off my extreme paranoia i immediately get up from his couch where i was sitting grab my phone and wallet from a nearby table and start putting my shoes on telling him that i was gonna go for a walk he tells me that it wasn t a good idea after some thought i reluctantly agree deciding that it wasn t the best idea to go outside when you re high as fuck off of shrooms but i m still just as paranoid so i go outside to a screened in porch like area through an adjoining sliding glass door in his apartment and just sit out there with his dog he brings tony into the living room with him now extremely concerned i chill for a bit outside and then come back inside and then tell him that i think he tried to drug me with the water and pull a bill cosby on me i argue with b and tony for a bit still not convinced that i can trust either one of them i then lock myself in their bathroom for about  minutes while i piece together the events that have unfolded in the past hour i sort out my thoughts try to make sense of everything and eventually come to the conclusion that i wasn t drugged and b wasn t tryna toss my salad i had known him for years if he wanted to drug and then rape someone he would have done it long before i hung out with him b is obviously hurt so i apologize to him and tony for being a cockhead and they both go to bed while i crash on the couch now with a killer stomach ache tl dr did shrooms with a friend and thought he pulled a a bill cosby on me turns out i was just being hella paranoid

452, by almost touching an art piece by giuseppe arcimboldo and sounding an alarm which called security so this happened many years ago when i was still a kid so i guess it wouldn t be  but i would really like to get this story off of my chest so i was in an art museum in france that was not the louve sorry if i misspelled that but it was still a pretty big art museum that had many famous collections of which one of them was a room full of paintings by giuseppe arcimboldo for those of you who don t know he was the artist that made the paintings of people made of food and other random things so let me start by saying that i had been walking all day and was therefore very tired you know when your in a new city you wanna see everything so you decide to walk everywhere so my back was absolutely killing me but we were in a rush to see everything since the museum was closing soon so there wasn t a chance for me to sit down so there i was walking enjoying the paintings when i reached the room or better say the hallway of where the said painting were kept and decided to walk up to the painting to get a better look so here is where the fu happens i turned around to talk to my brother and decided to put my hand on the wall for a little bit of rest however before i realized what i was doing my finger tip had already grazed the loose wall that holds up the painting for those of you who are confused in this art museum they hung up the works on separate stands and surround them with cloth walls so that if anyone tried to touch them a sensor would go off once the cloth moved so after barely grazing the cloth a super loud alarm goes off and i completely freaked out and bolted out of the room as fast as i could without looking like i was running away from a crime scene which a obviously was and in the corner of my eyes i saw that there were cameras pointing directly at the art works my mind went through a million thoughts what if they dragged me out of the museum there were cameras so they knew it was me so here i was freaking out thinking the worse would happen to me so to calm me down my aunt who was with us took us to the little cafe area that was in the middle of the museum to sit down and drink something but just as i thought that maybe everything would be ok a lady which looks like the manager of the museum comes in with what looks like security staff now here i really thought something would happen but the woman just walked passed our table without even looking at me and we left a little bit later most likely the staff of the museum looked over the museum video tapes and saw that i had not actually touched any of the art pieces and only grazed the wall by accident and decided to not really do anything let me just say that i am never getting that close to valuable art pieces again in the future tl dr i accidentally grazed the wall surrounding very valuable paintings and set off a very loud alarm which called secur, by almost

723,i'm afraid for my future because of my past i guess the short version is that i was poor and ignored all my morals to make a little bit of money but i have lost everything because of it well everything that mattered so i'm a artist and i'm the the millitary anyway the millitary fucked up my pay for like  months and i litterally couldn't live of my paycheck so i was doing commissions to but things i needed like food and hygiene the section i work in doesn't get the chow hall that offten due to our work schedule and they don't provide mres so we most of the time have to by food anyways i was doing commission for about   just so i could have food and stuff but eventually i ran out of normal clients and i was really hungry so i started doing more nsfw comms and that paid okay but the request got questionable but the clients paid quite well for the more questionable things so long story short i ended up starting to do loli lewds for clients and it sold really well but a far clients wanted better images so they suggested i find references and so me being desperate and not really thinking about it i asked around for refs i ended up finding a actual loli aged person to do it and it did improve my art but i hated it it felt gross and i quit as soon as my pay got fixed i'm not a pedo or anything never have been i just lacked good friends or people around me at the time to show me how stupid i was being anyway after my pay was finally fixed i quit doing comms as i was burned out so i tried to just let that part of my life fade away into nothingness and it did for a little bit until a few weeks ago where someone should screenshots of me asking for the loli refs to the girl i had been talking to for months at this point like   months and we had gotten quite close not dating her but that's a different topic the person told the girl and some of my irls friends and naturally they all cut me out of their life immediately which i don't blame them well except the girl she asked me many questions and i tried my best to explain but she lost all trust she had in me and now only talks to me because i promised to get professional help from a counselor and stuff and she wants to make sure i keep it and that i don't do anymore rash decisions but i've basically lost her for good and it hurts alot more than anything i've ever felt she was my best friend and the girl i had fell in love like deeply in live with we were about to create a nice collab piece and it would of been  but that's all gone she was my inspiration for everything and what has got be thru the past year i don't know how to function anymore i just always feel hollow and nothing i used to enjoy brings me joy i'm currently just existing day to day i have no purpose anymore i honestly hate when i'm not working the weekend is just pure agony as i no longer have anyone to enjoy it with ik people will say just find a new person and move on but the thing is i'm afraid of meeting new people as im scared ill just run them off somehow too i'll be honest i am doing counseling but it doesn't really feel like it helps i'm just always more sad or upset after my session anyway that's my story i'm not searching  pity or anything just don't have anyone else or anywhere else  share i'm just a  that has ruined their life hope yall are doing better than i am,i'm afraid for my future because of my past

back into the tree eh it s from a forest a few are normal nbd i go to get the next garland and accidentally shake the branch and then six six tiny bugs fall onto the table next to the tree i freeze

they are not stick bugs i look closer they are baby praying mantises oh no i know praying mantises are supposed to be large these are not large these are /tiny/ which means somewhere on this tree i

my head and neck i shake them off and keep unscrewing i feel them anyway they live in the sensation on my skin now we get half of the tree in the bag when we smell smoke the oil he was heating in the pan is about to catch fire cause he wasn t expecting this to take that long he rushes back to the kitchen somehow he has not had a single bug on him i am left holding up the tree with no free hands to swat the ones parading down my arms toward my face i blow them off of me like gimli trying to blow away ghosts in the mountain he comes back we finally get the tree in the bag and the bag to the tree

405, by adding coffee to my special cake this fuck up started january  and continued until yesterday my husband got some weed from a friend and since we have pretty much stopped smoking it i baked a cake instead i have been doing this occasionally for the past couple of years instead of smoking since i don't enjoy smoke and smoking and i like the high better when i eat it this time though i decided to add some coffee to the mix my mother in law gave us this nice carepackage as a christmas gift filled with delicious snacks teas homemade buns and some special christmas coffee the coffee has some orange chocolate and nut taste pretty neat i had had a cup or two of this coffee to taste it but i've actually cut way down on caffeine and actually quit a couple of months ago i also don't eat a lot of sugar and i try to moderate alcohol all this is because i have major anxiety and insomnia and i need to be careful about my blood sugar and so on since august  i've hyperventilated and almost daily have shortness of breath so my body is telling me pretty clearly to chill out and treat myself better my husband has also quit caffeine but for stomach reasons mostly well for some reason i thought it was the best idea to use this coffee that we would not otherwise drink in the cake and plenty of it too it made for a nice wet brownie like cake and tasted delicious since we're both just home right now we have been eating this cake everyday for the past four days cue surprised pikachu face when i get restless kind of uncomfortable and can't breathe or sleep properly and not at all last night in spite of eating a goddamn weed cake that usually chills me out last night was the worst night i was really tired and kind of dosed off only to be abruptly awaking by nothing really and then not being able to breathe properly because i can't calm down and then not getting any sleep the rest of the night and insomnia always makes me feel so sick like i'm hung over and got the flu i'm nauseous and so hungry it hurts without any appetite and i'm so thirsty but have to pee all the time even if i don't drink a lot so its impossible to even rest then today it dawns on me that i totally forgot to google whether the caffeine stays in the cake when you add coffee so i do and of course i learn that i've been on a four day caffeine bender oh yes i microdosed all day everyday instead of having a nice four day chill out after the hassle december is awesome i'm absolutely writing this down in my recipe never add coffee tl dr put coffee in my weedcake and binged it for four days even though caffeine is really bad for me atm, by adding coffee to my special cake this fuck up started january  and continued until yesterday my husband got some weed from a friend and since we have

164, by letting maggots flood my studio this actually happened earlier today i'm enjoying my morning coffee and smoke after waking up looking forward to a day of doing nothing at all the sun is  through my window i go to the kitchen i live in a very small studio but it's divided into kitchen office and bedroom and on my way back see this little white maggot crawling on the floor disgusting enough right i try to understand what i'm seeing with my slow still not caffeinated enough brain when i look over to my window and on the floor beneath it there are hundreds of thoses creep crawling white motherfuckers i really mean hundreds by the way i panic for a few seconds because that's a scene from a nightmare to me and don't have a fucking clue where they are coming from what are they if they are dangerous at all so i do what any reasonable and methodic person would to in this situation and start to pound the shit out of those maggots with my flip flops now just a clarification my house is actually pretty clean i keep it tidy but saturday is usually the dirtiest day since i don't really have much time or energy to do much in that regard in the weekdays it's definitively not the kind of home you'd expect to find maggots in that will be important in a few lines so i beat the shit of of those mf for maybe half and hour and they keep coming they are heavily concentrated under my window but some isolated ones are everywhere but they keep coming so the coffee kicks in and i start to be smart and look for the source of those fuckers i look into the cat litter nothing i look into the food bowl nothing i look into the bathroom not a single one there i open the trash can in the kitchen bingo there they are so again like a very moderate and methodic person i wrap the whole can in a bag and throw that shit away if i could i would burn it after getting rid of the source their numbers dwindled my final blow was looking into my cleaning products for the strongest thing there found a glowing greeen desinfectant not an overstatement that shit cannot be safe to use and mopped the floor franticaly with that in the hopes of killing every single living thing on the floor now with a calmer mind i looked them up and they are actually house fly maggots and they are not dangerous i cleaned every inch of my studio and thing seem to be spotless now but i still ocasionally take a lap around the house to look for them my mistake was simply not taking out the trash i usually just take out the trash whan the can is full but for some reason i spent this week without filling the can so i didn't bother and oh my i really regret it that's all folks remember that when your mother told you to take the trash every day she was right tl dr woke up to a house full of maggots because i

1050,i keep dreaming about other people besides my partner i ve been here before been thinking about my ex and even his new girlfriend y all might have seen another confession but it s more of dreams and then thoughts never anything sexual or overtly romantic just he s there kind of a what if/almost was type of dream first love blah blah recently i ve been dreaming about someone else the first few dreams were of my ex boyfriend these couple dreams have been about a guy i used to like back in high school most of the time it s a hug or a kiss or something that splits me and my current boyfriend

fallen out of love with me for both guys in my dreams it always ends up being me begging for forgiveness and wanting him back but he s fallen out of love i don t want to be in a different relationship i don t want any guys from my past i m jealous of people who have friends and my ex definitely is one of those people he s always posting how he s going on trips and shit with his friends they ve been going to the mountains a lot and it looks cool maybe it s because i m stir crazy the other guy sometimes posts on his story of just living and it s nothing more exciting than what i do but i m also caught up in the fact neither of them wanted me like my ex pretended to like me for  months and when we split he said he stopped liking me after  months he then kept pretending through high school but the point is he just let me pretend he liked me for my sake and the other guy was one of those what could ve been scenario he was best friends with my brother in k  so he was over all the time we bumped paths but never really got anywhere he used to flirt with my bestfriend so i kinda just gave up and then i shit you not he got together with a girl who acted and looked very similar to me overreaction probably i tie being unwanted by literally anyone back to being adopted and how my birth parents didn t want me but it s an excuse after years i still feel sparks aka tummy butterflies when i m with my boyfriend and he really is my safe space i wonder if maybe i m more worried about him falling out of love than i am concerned about other guys my eating disorder has gotten worse and i overthink when i binge eat and i feel disgusting it just radiates an awful emotion but again an excuse maybe i feel really f cking guilty over the dreams never sexual and barely romantic but they re

24, by mistaking dried bone broth for beef jerky and pouring it down my gullet my wife and i have recently been trying to find different ways to lose weight one of those ways involve changing some of our eating habits about a month ago she discovered a brand of protein bars that she started using as meal and snack replacements she offered it to me a few times and i finally caved about two days ago instantly was amazed by the flavor and incorporated into my diet as well fast forward to today and for dinner we had had a smaller than usual portion of food and about  hours later i was hit with a craving for more she was in the wash so i decided to creep into the pantry and see if we had anymore bars that i could snack on saw the bag of bars but then i noticed another pouch by the same company that was next to the bars and unopened this unopened pouch of secrets not see through caught my eye with a curious wonder without actually reading the bag i glanced at a few images and saw a cow on it i knew i had hit the jackpot this amazing brand who makes protein bars also makes its own beef jerky instantly i went and opened the pouch with scissors and inside were small skinny individual packaging no matter nowadays many beef jerky brands have come out with sticks so i thought nothing of it since it was so small i thought to myself head back and bottoms up whelp as the pour began a mound of powder hit the back of my throat i had flashbacks to the cinnamon challenge i did like  years ago i began to cough and was bewildered by this inconsistency with my expectations while navigating a could of dust and saliva i grabbed the parent packaging and look underneath the cow to read dried bone broth it was like concentrated seasoning within my mouth the overwhelming flavor was terrible at that volume and due to expectation management ruined my snacking moment after cleaning the mess i had created literally spitting up this stuff and it was everywhere i went to shower my confused wife noticed me as i walked into the bathroom after her and asked why i was covered in powder i told her what happened and she was in tears she always gets in me for skimming everything i read and not paying attention and this was a victory for her for once i had to just laugh at myself because she was  right apparently bone broth is becoming popular in the mainstream so a lot of brands are starting to branch out and sell it and the brand who makes the protein bars had it as a promotional sample offer hence the unique packaging tldr in a momentary lapse of judgement and increased greed i attempted to consume a package of concentrated bone broth and made a mess in my home not super crazy but definitely leaned to pay more attent, by mistaking dried bone broth for beef

172, by almost ruining the holidays with an inappropriate picture nsfw for obvious reasons obligatory this didn't happen to me today but rather on christmas morning  it was the first christmas my girlfriend and i really got to do it up our son was around  months old at the time so we wanted to make it really special for him for fear that he would start unwrapping the brightly colored shiny boxes under the tree we decided to stash all of the presents in a spare room we have the plan was to wake up extra early on christmas morning put all the presents under the tree and wait for him to wake up well the plan went off without a hitch we woke up super early and got everything taken care of in about  minutes it is now   am and son is still out cold i decided to go try and lay down to catch another   minutes of sleep and my gf wanted to wait up for the kid this is where it starts to go downhill i go and lay down but i quickly realize that i will not be going back to sleep so i think to myself maybe we can have a little early morning roll in the hay if you will so i decided that i'm gonna send m'lady a dick pic now i being the mostly out of touch millennial that i am don't use snapchat that often but i do know that people often use it to send nudes therefore i decided to channel my inner young person and take care of this with modern technology after a few attempts i finally got what i thought was a pretty nice dick pic good lighting angle you guys know what i'm talkin about i then add the words you want some christmas dick to the snap while reviewing placement of the words i decided that it wasn't festive enough at first i thought there might be a christmas light sticker but i settled on a bow here is the problem with being an old millennial and almost never using snapchat i was looking around for the button that adds a sticker to the picture ya know that little button in the bottom left corner that looks like a little square with a in the corner well my brain was like oh hey that looks like an add sticker button i tapped the button and it was gone my glorious tribute to my manhood had zoomed off to lands unknown and i had no idea where immediately i started panicking i quickly checked my story but i didn't see anything then i replicated what i had done but with a picture of the wall instead pressed the same button and poof it was gone i then went back to my story and there it was in all of its triumphant glory luckily the view counter still said  and luckier still i somehow knew how to delete a snapchat from your story just as quickly as it had come in to this world it was taken out after my heartbeat reached a semi normal rate i decided to get back in the saddle again and re do my masterpiece mission successful after a good laugh with my gf we ended up having a nice pre christmas morning i know the view counter said  but i wonder if someone who was hoping to see pictures of our son on christmas morning opened my story only to be met with a very festive dick pic nobody has said anything yet so i guess we will see and now every once in awhile my head will randomly say want some christmas dick and i burst out laughing tldr

everything taken care of in about  minutes it is now   am and son is still out cold i decided to go try and lay down to catch another   minutes of sleep and my gf wanted to wait up for the kid this is where it starts to go downhill i go and lay down but i quickly realize that i will not be going back to sleep so i think to myself maybe we can have a little early morning roll in the hay if you will so i decided that i'm gonna send m'lady a dick pic now i being the mostly out of touch millennial that i am don't use snapchat that often but i do know that people often use it to send nudes therefore i decided to channel my inner young person and take care of this with modern technology after a few attempts i finally got what i thought was a pretty nice dick pic good lighting angle you guys know what i'm talkin about i then add the words you want some christmas dick to the snap while reviewing placement of the words i decided that it wasn't festive enough at first i thought there might be a christmas light sticker but i settled on a bow here is the problem with being an old millennial and almost never using snapchat i was looking around for the button that adds a sticker to the picture ya know that little button in the bottom left corner that looks like a little square with a in the corner well my brain was like oh hey that looks like an add sticker button i tapped the button and it was gone my glorious tribute to my manhood had zoomed off to lands unknown and i had no idea where immediately i started panicking i quickly checked my story but i didn't see anything then i replicated what i had done but with a picture of the wall instead pressed the same button and poof it was gone i then went back to my story and there it was in all of its triumphant glory luckily the view counter still said  and luckier still i somehow knew how to delete a snapchat from your story just as quickly as it had come in to this world it was taken out after my heartbeat reached a semi normal rate i decided to get back in the saddle again and re do my masterpiece mission successful after a good laugh with my gf we ended up having a nice pre christmas morning i know the view counter said  but i wonder if someone who was hoping to see pictures of our son on christmas morning opened my story only to be met with a very festive dick pic nobody has said anything yet so i guess we will see and now every once in awhile my head will randomly say want some christmas dick and i burst out laughing tldr almost ruined christmas by posting a festive dick pick to my snap story edit thank you for the gold it's my first time getting some

152, by by going through my boyfriends things and finding a vail of 'sand' okay so disclaimer this happened while i was dating my now husband about  years ago i still laugh at this story in hindsight and wanted to share it with you so my bf and i had been dating for about a month and he decided to invited me over to his house for dinner i was pretty excited to be able to see where he lived and enjoy a nice night of pizza and netflix it was a pretty great night we had great chemistry and the pizza was good we hung out in his room to watch netflix because that was where he kept his largest tv and playstation we snuggled for a while and he excused himself to go to the bathroom 'perfect ' i thought 'now i can snoop for a bit ' i didn't want to violate his privacy too much but i was super curious and wanted to look at all the things he had out and about on his dresser and shelves fair game right he had lots to look at books collectibles photos and diffrent kinds of nick nacks as i was going through the shelves i found two containers of white sand one was a large glass round jar and the other was a small vial like what you would hang on a necklace both containers where sealed with rubber stoppers my first thought were that these were souvenirs from trips i myself owned a jar of sand and shells from florida from a family vacation i picked up and examined the larger and put it down no shells in it at all i then picked up the smaller vail and started rotating it to see if there was anything in the sand nope nothing turns out the stopper was not as secure on the small one much to my horror the stopper fell out and the sand went down my front and all over the floor i stood there trying to decide what to do there was no way to put the sand back maybe i could just hide it nope he returned to the room at that moment i turned around deer in the headlights 'i'm sorry i spilt this thing of sand ' 'uuhhhmmmm that wasn't sand that was full of my dead fiancé ashes ' so there i was not only caught in the act of snooping the moment he left the room but i was also coated in a fine layer of his dead fiancé i immediately start tearing up and shaking 'oh my god i'm so sorry i'm so sorry oh my god what do i dooooo ' i stood stock still my first thought was to try to brush his dead fiancé off my hands/shirt but that would be disrespectful right i mean i can't just shake her off of me and on to the floor omg i spilt her on the carpet what do we do she is everywhere he is going to be so pissed am i now going to be haunted by the angry ghost of his dead fiancé he was surprisingly calm for what was going on and quickly brushed me off he then walked me out side to dust my hands into the garden and then went to go get the vacuum all the while i'm blubbering like a baby dying from embarrassment and waiting to be scolded for spilling his dead fiancé all over myself he took me back inside and sat me down to calm down i must have sat there and cried for a good  minutes while he patted my back and tried to comfort me he was very kind and understanding but i was still so mortified not only did i spill the vail but i was also having a panic attack about it but in my defense its not everyday you accidentally spill a dead person on yourself but like he should be the upset one not me right i calmed down and he explained that it was okay he actually owned half of her ashes and they where safety out of my reach and in the top of the closet the vail was a memento from the ceremony i was quite lucky i didn't spill the larger one because that one was his dead best friend and all he had moral of the story dont snoop and if you keep dead people in your house please properly label them to avoid confusion tl dr while snooping through my bfs stuff i found and spilt a small vail of 'beach sand' plot twist it wasn't sand but the cremated remains of his dead fiancé, by by going through my boyfriends things and finding a vail of 'sand' okay so disclaimer this
